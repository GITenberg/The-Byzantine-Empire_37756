        <span style="font-size: 173%">Preface.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fifty years ago
        the word <span class="tei tei-q">“Byzantine”</span> was used as a
        synonym for all that was corrupt and decadent, and the tale of the
        East-Roman Empire was dismissed by modern historians as depressing
        and monotonous. The great Gibbon had branded the successors of
        Justinian and Heraclius as a series of vicious weaklings, and for
        several generations no one dared to contradict him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two books have
        served to undeceive the English reader, the monumental work of
        Finlay, published in 1856, and the more modern volumes of Mr. Bury,
        which appeared in 1889. Since they have written, the Byzantines no
        longer need an apologist, and the great work of the East-Roman Empire
        in holding back the Saracen, and in keeping alive throughout the Dark
        Ages the lamp of learning, is beginning to be realized.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The writer of this
        book has endeavoured to tell the story of Byzantium in the spirit of
        Finlay and Bury, not in that of Gibbon. He wishes to acknowledge his
        debts both to the veteran of the war of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Greek Independence, and to the young Dublin
        professor. Without their aid his task would have been very heavy—with
        it the difficulty was removed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The author does
        not claim to have grappled with all the chroniclers of the Eastern
        realm, but thinks that some acquaintance with Ammianus, Procopius,
        Maurice's <span class="tei tei-q">“Strategikon,”</span> Leo the
        Deacon, Leo the Wise, Constantine Porphyrogenitus, Anna Comnena and
        Nicetas, may justify his having undertaken the task he has
        essayed.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 173%">I. Byzantium.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two thousand five
        hundred and fifty-eight years ago a little fleet of galleys toiled
        painfully against the current up the long strait of the Hellespont,
        rowed across the broad Propontis, and came to anchor in the smooth
        waters of the first inlet which cuts into the European shore of the
        Bosphorus. There a long crescent-shaped creek, which after-ages were
        to know as the Golden Horn, strikes inland for seven miles, forming a
        quiet backwater from the rapid stream which runs outside. On the
        headland, enclosed between this inlet and the open sea, a few hundred
        colonists disembarked, and hastily secured themselves from the wild
        tribes of the inland, by running some rough sort of a stockade across
        the ground from beach to beach. Thus was founded the city of
        Byzantium.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The settlers were
        Greeks of the Dorian race, natives of the thriving seaport-state of
        Megara, one of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg
        002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        most enterprising of all the cities of Hellas in the time of colonial
        and commercial expansion which was then at its height. Wherever a
        Greek prow had cut its way into unknown waters, there Megarian seamen
        were soon found following in its wake. One band of these venturesome
        traders pushed far to the West to plant colonies in Sicily, but the
        larger share of the attention of Megara was turned towards the
        sunrising, towards the mist-enshrouded entrance of the Black Sea and
        the fabulous lands that lay beyond. There, as legends told, was to be
        found the realm of the Golden Fleece, the Eldorado of the ancient
        world, where kings of untold wealth reigned over the tribes of
        Colchis: there dwelt, by the banks of the river Thermodon, the
        Amazons, the warlike women who had once vexed far-off Greece by their
        inroads: there, too, was to be found, if one could but struggle far
        enough up its northern shore, the land of the Hyperboreans, the
        blessed folk who dwell behind the North Wind and know nothing of
        storm and winter. To seek these fabled wonders the Greeks sailed ever
        North and East till they had come to the extreme limits of the sea.
        The riches of the Golden Fleece they did not find, nor the country of
        the Hyperboreans, nor the tribes of the Amazons; but they did
        discover many lands well worth the knowing, and grew rich on the
        profits which they drew from the metals of Colchis and the forests of
        Paphlagonia, from the rich corn lands by the banks of the Dnieper and
        Bug, and the fisheries of the Bosphorus and the Maeotic Lake.
        Presently the whole coastland of the sea, which the Greeks, on their
        first coming, called <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg
        003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Axeinos—<span class="tei tei-q">“the Inhospitable”</span>—became
        fringed with trading settlements, and its name was changed to
        Euxeinos—<span class="tei tei-q">“the Hospitable”</span>—in
        recognition of its friendly ports. It was in a similar spirit that,
        two thousand years later, the seamen who led the next great impulse
        of exploration that rose in Europe, turned the name of the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Cape of Storms”</span> into that of the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Cape of Good Hope.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Megarians,
        almost more than any other Greeks, devoted their attention to the
        Euxine, and the foundation of Byzantium was but one of their many
        achievements. Already, seventeen years before Byzantium came into
        being, another band of Megarian colonists had established themselves
        at Chalcedon, on the opposite Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus. The
        settlers who were destined to found the greater city applied to the
        oracle of Delphi to give them advice as to the site of their new
        home, and Apollo, we are told, bade them <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“build their town over against the city of the
        blind.”</span> They therefore pitched upon the headland by the Golden
        Horn, reasoning that the Chalcedonians were truly blind to have
        neglected the more eligible site on the Thracian shore, in order to
        found a colony on the far less inviting Bithynian side of the
        strait.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the first its
        situation marked out Byzantium as destined for a great future. Alike
        from the military and from the commercial point of view no city could
        have been better placed. Looking out from the easternmost headland of
        Thrace, with all Europe behind it and all Asia before, it was equally
        well suited to be the frontier fortress to defend the border
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004"
        id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the one, or the basis of
        operations for an invasion from the other. As fortresses went in
        those early days it was almost impregnable—two sides protected by the
        water, the third by a strong wall not commanded by any neighbouring
        heights. In all its early history Byzantium never fell by storm:
        famine or treachery accounted for the few occasions on which it fell
        into the hands of an enemy. In its commercial aspect the place was
        even more favourably situated. It completely commanded the whole
        Black Sea trade: every vessel that went forth from Greece or Ionia to
        traffic with Scythia or Colchis, the lands by the Danube mouth or the
        shores of the Maeotic Lake, had to pass close under its walls, so
        that the prosperity of a hundred Hellenic towns on the Euxine was
        always at the mercy of the masters of Byzantium. The Greek loved
        short stages and frequent stoppages, and as a half-way house alone
        Byzantium would have been prosperous: but it had also a flourishing
        local trade of its own with the tribes of the neighbouring Thracian
        inland, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name=
        "Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and drew much profit
        from its fisheries: so much so that the city badge—its coat of arms
        as we should call it—comprised a tunny-fish as well as the famous ox
        whose form alluded to the legend of the naming of the
        Bosphorus.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href=
        "#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As an independent
        state Byzantium had a long and eventful history. For thirty years it
        was in the hands of the kings of Persia, but with that short
        exception it maintained its freedom during the first three hundred
        years that followed its foundation. Many stirring scenes took place
        beneath its walls: it was close to them that the great Darius threw
        across the Bosphorus his bridge of boats, which served as a model for
        the more famous structure on which his son Xerxes crossed the
        Hellespont. Fifteen years later, when Byzantium in common with all
        its neighbours made an ineffectual attempt to throw off the Persian
        yoke, in the rising called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Ionic
        Revolt,”</span> it was held for a time by the arch-rebel Histiaeus,
        who—as much to enrich himself as to pay his seamen—invented strait
        dues. He forced every ship passing up or down the Bosphorus to pay a
        heavy toll, and won no small unpopularity thereby for the cause of
        freedom which he professed to champion. Ere long Byzantium fell back
        again into the hands of Persia, but she was finally freed from the
        Oriental yoke seventeen years later, when the victorious Greeks,
        fresh from the triumph of Salamis and Mycale, sailed up to her walls
        and after a long leaguer starved out <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the obstinate garrison [<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 479]. The fleet
        wintered there, and it was at Byzantium that the first foundations of
        the naval empire of Athens were laid, when all the Greek states of
        Asia placed their ships at the disposal of the Athenian admirals
        Cimon and Aristeides.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the fifth
        century Byzantium twice declared war on Athens, now the mistress of
        the seas, and on each occasion fell into the hands of the enemy—once
        by voluntary surrender in 439 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, once by treachery from
        within, in 408 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> But the Athenians,
        except in one or two disgraceful cases, did not deal hardly with
        their conquered enemies, and the Byzantines escaped anything harder
        than the payment of a heavy war indemnity. In a few years their
        commercial gains repaired all the losses of war, and the state was
        itself again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We know
        comparatively little about the internal history of these early
        centuries of the life of Byzantium. Some odd fragments of information
        survive here and there: we know, for example, that they used iron
        instead of copper for small money, a peculiarity shared by no other
        ancient state save Sparta. Their alphabet rejoiced in an abnormally
        shaped Β, which puzzled all other Greeks, for it resembled a Π with
        an extra limb.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href=
        "#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> The chief
        gods of the city were those that we might have expected—Poseidon the
        ruler of the sea, whose blessing gave Byzantium its chief wealth; and
        Demeter, the goddess who presided over the Thracian and Scythian corn
        lands which formed its second source of prosperity.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Byzantines
        were, if ancient chroniclers tell us the truth, a luxurious as well
        as a busy race: they spent too much time in their numerous inns,
        where the excellent wines of Maronea and other neighbouring places
        offered great temptations. They were gluttons too as well as
        tipplers: on one occasion, we are assured, the whole civic militia
        struck work in the height of a siege, till their commander consented
        to allow restaurants to be erected at convenient distances round the
        ramparts. One comic writer informs us that the Byzantines were eating
        young tunny-fish—their favourite dish—so constantly, that their whole
        bodies had become well-nigh gelatinous, and it was thought they might
        melt if exposed to too great heat! Probably these tales are the
        scandals of neighbours who envied Byzantine prosperity, for it is at
        any rate certain that the city showed all through its history great
        energy and love of independence, and never shrank from war as we
        should have expected a nation of epicures to do.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not till
        the rise of Philip of Macedon and his greater son Alexander that
        Byzantium fell for the fifth time into the hands of an enemy. The
        elder king was repulsed from the city's walls after a long siege,
        culminating in an attempt at an escalade by night, which was
        frustrated owing to the sudden appearance of a light in heaven, which
        revealed the advancing enemy and was taken by the Byzantines as a
        token of special divine aid [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 339]. In commemoration
        of it they assumed as one of their civic badges the blazing crescent
        and star, which has descended to our own days and is still used as an
        emblem by the present <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg
        008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        owners of the city—the Ottoman Sultans. But after repulsing Philip
        the Byzantines had to submit some years later to Alexander. They
        formed under him part of the enormous Macedonian empire, and passed
        on his decease through the hands of his successors—Demetrius
        Poliorcetes, and Lysimachus. After the death of the latter in battle,
        however, they recovered a precarious freedom, and were again an
        independent community for a hundred years, till the power of Rome
        invaded the regions of Thrace and the Hellespont.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Byzantium was one
        of the cities which took the wise course of making an early alliance
        with the Romans, and obtained good and easy terms in consequence.
        During the wars of Rome with Macedon and Antiochus the Great it
        proved such a faithful assistant that the Senate gave it the status
        of a <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">civitas libera et
        foederata</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“a free and
        confederate city,”</span> and it was not taken under direct Roman
        government, but allowed complete liberty in everything save the
        control of its foreign relations and the payment of a tribute to
        Rome. It was not till the Roman Republic had long passed away, that
        the Emperor Vespasian stripped it of these privileges, and threw it
        into the province of Thrace, to exist for the future as an ordinary
        provincial town [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 73].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though deprived of
        a liberty which had for long years been almost nominal, Byzantium
        could not be deprived of its unrivalled position for commerce. It
        continued to flourish under the <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Pax
        Romana</span></span>, the long-continued peace which all the inner
        countries of the empire enjoyed during the first two centuries of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009"
        id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the imperial <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">régime</span></span>, and is mentioned again and
        again as one of the most important cities of the middle regions of
        the Roman world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But an evil time
        for Byzantium, as for all the other parts of the civilized world,
        began when the golden age of the Antonines ceased, and the epoch of
        the military emperors followed. In 192 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, Commodus, the unworthy
        son of the great and good Marcus Aurelius, was murdered, and ere long
        three military usurpers were wrangling for his blood-stained diadem.
        Most unhappily for itself Byzantium lay on the line of division
        between the eastern provinces, where Pescennius Niger had been
        proclaimed, and the Illyrian provinces, where Severus had assumed the
        imperial style. The city was seized by the army of Syria, and
        strengthened in haste. Presently Severus appeared from the west,
        after he had made himself master of Rome and Italy, and fell upon the
        forces of his rival Pescennius. Victory followed the arms of the
        Illyrian legions, the east was subdued, and the Syrian emperor put to
        death. But when all his other adherents had yielded, the garrison of
        Byzantium refused to submit. For more than two years they maintained
        the impregnable city against the lieutenants of Severus, and it was
        not till <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 196 that they were
        forced to yield. The emperor appeared in person to punish the
        long-protracted resistance of the town; not only the garrison, but
        the civil magistrates of Byzantium were slain before his eyes. The
        massive walls <span class="tei tei-q">“so firmly built with great
        square stones clamped together with bolts of iron, that the whole
        seemed but one block,”</span> were laboriously cast down. The
        property <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg
        010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        the citizens was confiscated, and the town itself deprived of all
        municipal privileges and handed over to be governed like a dependent
        village by its neighbours of Perinthus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Caracalla, the son
        of Severus, gave back to the Byzantines the right to govern
        themselves, but the town had received a hard blow, and would have
        required a long spell of peace to recover its prosperity. Peace
        however it was not destined to see. All through the middle years of
        the third century it was vexed by the incursions of the Goths, who
        harried mercilessly the countries on the Black Sea whose commerce
        sustained its trade. Under Gallienus in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 263 it was again seized
        by an usurping emperor, and shared the fate of his adherents. The
        soldiers of Gallienus sacked Byzantium from cellar to garret, and
        made such a slaughter of its inhabitants that it is said that the old
        Megarian race who had so long possessed it were absolutely
        exterminated. But the irresistible attraction of the site was too
        great to allow its ruins to remain desolate. Within ten years after
        its sack by the army of Gallienus, we find Byzantium again a populous
        town, and its inhabitants are specially praised by the historian
        Trebellius Pollio for the courage with which they repelled a Gothic
        raid in the reign of Claudius II.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The strong
        Illyrian emperors, who staved off from the Roman Empire the ruin
        which appeared about to overwhelm it in the third quarter of the
        third century, gave Byzantium time and peace to recover its ancient
        prosperity. It profited especially from the constant neighbourhood of
        the imperial court, after Diocletian <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> fixed his residence at Nicomedia, only sixty
        miles away, on the Bithynian side of the Propontis. But the military
        importance of Byzantium was always interfering with its commercial
        greatness. After the abdication of Diocletian the empire was for
        twenty years vexed by constant partitions of territory between the
        colleagues whom he left behind him. Byzantium after a while found
        itself the border fortress of Licinius, the emperor who ruled in the
        Balkan Peninsula, while Maximinus Daza was governing the Asiatic
        provinces. While Licinius was absent in Italy, Maximinus
        treacherously attacked his rival's dominions without declaration of
        war, and took Byzantium by surprise. But the Illyrian emperor
        returned in haste, defeated his grasping neighbour not far from the
        walls of the city, and recovered his great frontier fortress after it
        had been only a few months out of his hands [<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 314]. The town must
        have suffered severely by changing masters twice in the same year; it
        does not, however, seem to have been sacked or burnt, as was so often
        the case with a captured city in those dismal days. But Licinius when
        he had recovered the place set to work to render it impregnable.
        Though it was not his capital he made it the chief fortress of his
        realm, which, since the defeat of Maximinus, embraced the whole
        eastern half of the Roman world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was accordingly
        at Byzantium that Licinius made his last desperate stand, when in
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 323 he found himself
        engaged in an unsuccessful war with his brother-in-law Constantine,
        the Emperor of the West. For many months the war stood still beneath
        the walls of the city; but Constantine persevered in <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the siege, raising great mounds which
        overlooked the walls, and sweeping away the defenders by a constant
        stream of missiles, launched from dozens of military engines which he
        had erected on these artificial heights. At last the city
        surrendered, and the cause of Licinius was lost. Constantine, the
        last of his rivals subdued, became the sole emperor of the Roman
        world, and stood a victor on the ramparts which were ever afterwards
        to bear his name.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the fall of
        Byzantium had wrecked the fortunes of Licinius, the Roman world was
        again united beneath the sceptre of a single master. For thirty-seven
        years, ever since Diocletian parcelled out the provinces with his
        colleagues, unity had been unknown, and emperors, whose number had
        sometimes risen to six and sometimes sunk to two, had administered
        their realms on different principles and with varying success.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Constantine, whose
        victory over his rivals had been secured by his talents as an
        administrator and a diplomatist no less than by his military skill,
        was one of those men whose hard practical ability has stamped upon
        the history of the world a much deeper impress than has been left by
        many conquerors and legislators of infinitely greater genius. He was
        a man of that self-contained, self-reliant, unsympathetic type of
        mind <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though the strain
        of old Roman blood in his veins must have been but small, Constantine
        was in many ways a typical Roman; the hard, cold, steady, unwearying
        energy, which in earlier centuries had won the empire of the world,
        was once more incarnate in him. But if Roman in character, he was
        anything but Roman in his sympathies. Born by the Danube,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015"
        id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> reared in the courts and camps
        of Asia and Gaul, he was absolutely free from any of that
        superstitious reverence for the ancient glories of the city on the
        Tiber which had inspired so many of his predecessors. Italy was to
        him but a secondary province amongst his wide realms. When he
        distributed his dominions among his heirs, it was Gaul that he gave
        as the noblest share to his eldest and best-loved son: Italy was to
        him a younger child's portion. There had been emperors before him who
        had neglected Rome: the barbarian Maximinus I. had dwelt by the Rhine
        and the Danube; the politic Diocletian had chosen Nicomedia as his
        favourite residence. But no one had yet dreamed of raising up a rival
        to the mistress of the world, and of turning Rome into a provincial
        town. If preceding emperors had dwelt far afield, it was to meet the
        exigencies of war on the frontiers or the government of distant
        provinces. It was reserved for Constantine to erect over against Rome
        a rival metropolis for the civilized world, an imperial city which
        was to be neither a mere camp nor a mere court, but the
        administrative and commercial centre of the Roman world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For more than a
        hundred years Rome had been a most inconvenient residence for the
        emperors. The main problem which had been before them was the
        repelling of incessant barbarian inroads on the Balkan Peninsula; the
        troubles on the Rhine and the Euphrates, though real enough, had been
        but minor evils. Rome, placed half way down the long projection of
        Italy, handicapped by its bad harbours and separated from the rest of
        the empire by the passes of the Alps, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> was too far away from the points where the
        emperor was most wanted—the banks of the Danube and the walls of
        Sirmium and Singidunum. For the ever-recurring wars with Persia it
        was even more inconvenient; but these were less pressing dangers; no
        Persian army had yet penetrated beyond Antioch—only 200 miles from
        the frontier—while in the Balkan Peninsula the Goths had broken so
        far into the heart of the empire as to sack Athens and
        Thessalonica.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Constantine, with
        all the Roman world at his feet, and all its responsibilities
        weighing on his mind, was far too able a man to overlook the great
        need of the day—a more conveniently placed administrative and
        military centre for his empire. He required a place that should be
        easily accessible by land and sea—which Rome had never been in spite
        of its wonderful roads—that should overlook the Danube lands, without
        being too far away from the East; that should be so strongly situated
        that it might prove an impregnable arsenal and citadel against
        barbarian attacks from the north; that should at the same time be far
        enough away from the turmoil of the actual frontier to afford a safe
        and splendid residence for the imperial court. The names of several
        towns are given by historians as having suggested themselves to
        Constantine. First was his own birth-place—Naissus (Nisch) on the
        Morava, in the heart of the Balkan Peninsula; but Naissus had little
        to recommend it: it was too close to the frontier and too far from
        the sea. Sardica—the modern Sofia in Bulgaria—was liable to the same
        objections, and had not the sole advantage of Naissus, that of being
        connected in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg
        017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        sentiment with the emperor's early days. Nicomedia on its long gulf
        at the east end of the Propontis was a more eligible situation in
        every way, and had already served as an imperial residence. But all
        that could be urged in favour of Nicomedia applied with double force
        to Byzantium, and, in addition, Constantine had no wish to choose a
        city in which his own memory would be eclipsed by that of his
        predecessor Diocletian, and whose name was associated by the
        Christians, the class of his subjects whom he had most favoured of
        late, with the persecutions of Diocletian and Galerius. For Ilium,
        the last place on which Constantine had cast his mind, nothing could
        be alleged except its ancient legendary glories, and the fact that
        the mythologists of Rome had always fabled that their city drew its
        origin from the exiled Trojans of Æneas. Though close to the sea it
        had no good harbour, and it was just too far from the mouth of the
        Hellespont to command effectually the exit of the Euxine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Byzantium, on the
        other hand, was thoroughly well known to Constantine. For months his
        camp had been pitched beneath its walls; he must have known
        accurately every inch of its environs, and none of its military
        advantages can have missed his eye. Nothing, then, could have been
        more natural than his selection of the old Megarian city for his new
        capital. Yet the Roman world was startled at the first news of his
        choice; Byzantium had been so long known merely as a great port of
        call for the Euxine trade, and as a first-class provincial fortress,
        that it was hard to conceive of it as a destined seat of
        empire.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg
        018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When once
        Constantine had determined to make Byzantium his capital, in
        preference to any other place in the Balkan lands, his measures were
        taken with his usual energy and thoroughness. The limits of the new
        city were at once marked out by solemn processions in the old Roman
        style. In later ages a picturesque legend was told to account for the
        magnificent scale on which it was planned. The emperor, we read,
        marched out on foot, followed by all his court, and traced with his
        spear the line where the new fortifications were to be drawn. As he
        paced on further and further westward along the shore of the Golden
        Horn, till he was more than two miles away from his starting-point,
        the gate of old Byzantium, his attendants grew more and more
        surprised at the vastness of his scheme. At last they ventured to
        observe that he had already exceeded the most ample limits that an
        imperial city could require. But Constantine turned to rebuke them:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall go on,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“until He, the invisible guide who marches before me,
        thinks fit to stop.”</span> Guided by his mysterious presentiment of
        greatness, the emperor advanced till he was three miles from the
        eastern angle of Byzantium, and only turned his steps when he had
        included in his boundary line all the seven hills which are embraced
        in the peninsula between the Propontis and the Golden Horn.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rising ground
        just outside the walls of the old city, where Constantine's tent had
        been pitched during the siege of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
        323, was selected out as the market-place of the new foundation.
        There he erected the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Milion</span></span>, or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“golden milestone,”</span> from which all the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019"
        id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> distances of the eastern world
        were in future to be measured. This <span class="tei tei-q">“central
        point of the world”</span> was not a mere single stone, but a small
        building like a temple, its roof supported by seven pillars; within
        was placed the statue of the emperor, together with that of his
        venerated mother, the Christian Empress Helena.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The south-eastern
        part of the old town of Byzantium was chosen by Constantine for the
        site of his imperial palace. The spot was cleared of all private
        dwellings for a space of 150 acres, to give space not only for a
        magnificent residence for his whole court, but for spacious gardens
        and pleasure-grounds. A wall, commencing at the Lighthouse, where the
        Bosphorus joins the Propontis, turned inland and swept along parallel
        to the shore for about a mile, in order to shut off the imperial
        precinct from the city.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">North-west of the
        palace lay the central open space in which the life of Constantinople
        was to find its centre. This was the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Augustaeum,”</span> a splendid oblong forum, about a
        thousand feet long by three hundred broad. It was paved with marble
        and surrounded on all sides by stately public buildings. To its east,
        as we have already said, lay the imperial palace, but between the
        palace and the open space were three detached edifices connected by a
        colonnade. Of these, the most easterly was the Great Baths, known,
        from their builder, as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Baths of
        Zeuxippus.”</span> They were built on the same magnificent scale
        which the earlier emperors had used in Old Rome, though they could
        not, perhaps, vie in size with the enormous Baths <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Caracalla. Constantine utilized and
        enlarged the old public bath of Byzantium, which had been rebuilt
        after the taking of the city by Severus. He adorned the frontage and
        courts of the edifice with statues taken from every prominent town of
        Greece and Asia, the old Hellenic masterpieces which had escaped the
        rapacious hands of twelve generations of plundering proconsuls and
        Cæsars. There were to be seen the Athene of Lyndus, the Amphithrite
        of Rhodes, the Pan which had been consecrated by the Greeks after the
        defeat of Xerxes, and the Zeus of Dodona.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Adjoining the
        Baths, to the north, lay the second great building, on the east side
        of the Augustaeum—the Senate House. Constantine had determined to
        endow his new city with a senate modelled on that of Old Rome, and
        had indeed persuaded many old senatorial families to migrate eastward
        by judicious gifts of pensions and houses. We know that the assembly
        was worthily housed, but no details survive about Constantine's
        building, on account of its having been twice destroyed within the
        century. But, like the Baths of Zeuxippus, it was adorned with
        ancient statuary, among which the Nine Muses of Helicon are specially
        cited by the historian who describes the burning of the place in
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 404.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Linked to the
        Senate House by a colonnade, lay on the north the Palace of the
        Patriarch, as the Bishop of Byzantium was ere long to be called, when
        raised to the same status as his brethren of Antioch and Alexandria.
        A fine building in itself, with a spacious hall of audience and a
        garden, the patriarchal dwelling <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> was yet completely overshadowed by the imperial
        palace which rose behind it. And so it was with the patriarch
        himself: he lived too near his royal master to be able to gain any
        independent authority. Physically and morally alike he was too much
        overlooked by his august neighbour, and never found the least
        opportunity of setting up an independent spiritual authority over
        against the civil government, or of founding an <span lang="la"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All along the
        western side of the Augustaeum, facing the three buildings which we
        have already described, lay an edifice which played a very prominent
        part in the public life of Constantinople. This was the great
        Hippodrome, a splendid circus 640 cubits long and 160 broad, in which
        were renewed the games that Old Rome had known so well. The whole
        system the chariot-races between the teams that represented the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“factions”</span> of the Circus was
        reproduced at Byzantium with an energy that even surpassed the
        devotion of the Romans to horse racing. From the first foundation of
        the city the rivalry of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Blues”</span>
        and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Greens”</span> was one of the most
        striking features of the life of the place. It was carried far beyond
        the circus, and spread into all branches of life. We often hear of
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“Green”</span> faction identifying itself
        with Arianism, or of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Blue”</span>
        supporting a pretender to the throne. Not merely men of sporting
        interests, but persons of all ranks and professions, chose their
        colour and backed their faction. The system was a positive danger to
        the public peace, and constantly led to riots, culminating
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024"
        id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the great sedition of
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 523, which we shall
        presently have to describe at length. In the Hippodrome the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Greens”</span> always entered by the
        north-eastern gate, and sat on the east side; the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Blues”</span> approached by the north-western gate and
        stretched along the western side. The emperor's box, called the
        Kathisma, occupied the whole of the short northern side, and
        contained many hundreds of seats for the imperial retinue. The great
        central throne of the Kathisma was the place in which the monarch
        showed himself most frequently to his subjects, and around it many
        strange scenes were enacted. It was on this throne that the rebel
        Hypatius was crowned emperor by the mob, with his own wife's necklace
        for an impromptu diadem. Here also, two centuries later, the Emperor
        Justinian II. sat in state after his reconquest of Constantinople,
        with his rivals, Leontius and Apsimarus, bound beneath his footstool,
        while the populace chanted, in allusion to the names of the
        vanquished princes, the verse, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt
        trample on the Lion and the Asp.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Down the centre of
        the Hippodrome ran the <span class="tei tei-q">“spina,”</span> or
        division wall, which every circus showed; it was ornamented with
        three most curious monuments, whose strange juxtaposition seemed
        almost to typify the heterogeneous materials from which the new city
        was built up. The first and oldest was an obelisk brought from Egypt,
        and covered with the usual hieroglyphic inscriptions; the second was
        the most notable, though one of the least beautiful, of the
        antiquities of Constantinople: it was the three-headed brazen serpent
        which Pausanias and the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg
        025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        victorious Greeks had dedicated at Delphi in 479 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, after they had
        destroyed the Persian army at Platæa. The golden tripod, which was
        supported by the heads of the serpents, had long been wanting: the
        sacrilegious Phocians had stolen it six centuries before; but the
        dedicatory inscriptions engraved on the coils of the pedestal
        survived then and survive now to delight the archæologist. The third
        monument on the <span class="tei tei-q">“spina”</span> was a square
        bronze column of more modern work, contrasting strangely with the
        venerable antiquity of its neighbours. By some freak of chance all
        three monuments have remained till our own day: the vast walls of the
        Hippodrome have crumbled away, but its central decorations still
        stand erect in the midst of an open space which the Turks call the
        Atmeidan, or place of horses, in dim memory of its ancient use.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Along the outer
        eastern wall of the Hippodrome on the western edge of the Augustaeum,
        stood a range of small chapels and statues, the most important
        landmark among them being the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Milion</span></span> or central milestone of the
        empire, which we have already described. The statues, few at first,
        were increased by later emperors, till they extended along the whole
        length of the forum. Constantine's own contribution to the collection
        was a tall porphyry column surmounted by a bronze image which had
        once been the tutelary Apollo of the city of Hierapolis, but was
        turned into a representation of the emperor by the easy method of
        knocking off its head and substituting the imperial features. It was
        exactly the reverse of a change which can be seen at <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Rome, where the popes have removed the
        head of the Emperor Aurelius, and turned him into St. Peter, on the
        column in the Corso.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">North of the
        Hippodrome stood the great church which Constantine erected for his
        Christian subjects, and dedicated to the Divine Wisdom (<span lang=
        "el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Hagia Sophia</span></span>). It was not the
        famous domed edifice which now bears that name, but an earlier and
        humbler building, probably of the Basilica-shape then usual. Burnt
        down once in the fifth and once in the sixth centuries, it has left
        no trace of its original character. From the west door of St. Sophia
        a wooden gallery, supported on arches, crossed the square, and
        finally ended at the <span class="tei tei-q">“Royal Gate”</span> of
        the palace. By this the emperor would betake himself to divine
        service without having to cross the street of the Chalcoprateia
        (brass market), which lay opposite to St. Sophia. The general effect
        of the gallery must have been somewhat like that of the curious
        passage perched aloft on arches which connects the Pitti and Uffizi
        palaces at Florence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The edifices which
        we have described formed the heart of Constantinople. Between the
        Palace, the Hippodrome, and the Cathedral most of the important
        events in the history of the city took place. But to north and west
        the city extended for miles, and everywhere there were buildings of
        note, though no other cluster could vie with that round the
        Augustaeum. The Church of the Holy Apostles, which Constantine
        destined as the burying-place of his family, was the second among the
        ecclesiastical edifices of the town. Of the outlying civil buildings,
        the public <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg
        028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        granaries along the quays, the Golden Gate, by which the great road
        from the west entered the walls, and the palace of the praetorian
        praefect, who acted as governor of the city, must all have been well
        worthy of notice. A statue of Constantine on horseback, which stood
        by the last-named edifice, was one of the chief shows of
        Constantinople down to the end of the Middle Ages, and some curious
        legends gathered around it.</p>

        date is not easily to be fixed—that Constantine had definitely chosen
        Byzantium for his capital, and drawn out the plan for its
        development. As early as May 11, 330, the buildings were so far
        advanced that he was able to hold the festival which celebrated its
        consecration. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg
        029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Christian bishops blessed the partially completed palace, and held
        the first service in St. Sophia; for Constantine, though still
        unbaptized himself, had determined that the new city should be
        Christian from the first. Of paganism there was no trace in it, save
        a few of the old temples of the Byzantines, spared when the older
        streets were levelled to clear the ground for the palace and
        adjoining buildings. The statues of the gods which adorned the Baths
        and Senate House stood there as works of art, not as objects of
        worship.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To fill the vast
        limits of his city, Constantine invited many senators of Old Rome and
        many rich provincial proprietors of Greece and Asia to take up their
        abode in it, granting them places in his new senate and sites for the
        dwellings they would require. The countless officers and
        functionaries of the imperial court, with their subordinates and
        slaves, must have composed a very considerable element in the new
        population. The artizans and handicraftsmen were enticed in thousands
        by the offer of special privileges. Merchants and seamen had always
        abounded at Byzantium, and now flocked in numbers which made the old
        commercial prosperity of the city seem insignificant. Most
        effective—though most demoralizing—of the gifts which Constantine
        bestowed on the new capital to attract immigrants was the old Roman
        privilege of free distribution of corn to the populace. The
        wheat-tribute of Egypt, which had previously formed part of the
        public provision of Rome, was transferred to the use of
        Constantinople, only the African corn from Carthage <span class=

        the city the title of New Rome, and the record was placed on a marble
        tablet near the equestrian statue of the emperor, opposite the
        Strategion. But <span class="tei tei-q">“New Rome”</span> was a
        phrase destined to subsist in poetry and rhetoric alone: the world
        from the first very rightly gave the city the founder's name only,
        and persisted in calling it Constantinople.</p>

        death-bed into that Christian Church on whose verge he had lingered
        during the last half of his life. By his will he left his realm to be
        divided among his sons and nephews; but a rapid succession of murders
        and civil wars thinned out the imperial house, and ended in the
        concentration of the whole empire from the Forth to the Tigris under
        the sceptre of Constantius II., the second son of the great emperor.
        The Roman world was not yet quite ripe for a permanent division; it
        was still possible to manage it from a single centre, for by some
        strange chance the barbarian invasions which had troubled the third
        century had ceased for a time, and the Romans were untroubled, save
        by some minor bickerings on the Rhine and the Euphrates. Constantius
        II., an administrator of some ability, but gloomy, suspicious, and
        unsympathetic, was able to devote his leisure to ecclesiastical
        controversies, and to dishonour himself by starting the first
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032"

        Christian that the world had seen. The crisis in the history of the
        empire was not destined to fall in his day, nor in the short reign of
        his cousin and successor, Julian, the amiable and cultured, but
        entirely wrongheaded, pagan zealot, who strove to put back the clock
        of time and restore the worship of the ancient gods of Greece. Both
        Constantius and Julian, if asked whence danger to the empire might be
        expected, would have pointed eastward, to the Mesopotamian frontier,
        where their great enemy, Sapor King of Persia, strove, with no very
        great success, to break through the line of Roman fortresses that
        protected Syria and Asia Minor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it was not in

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a hundred and
        fifty years the Romans had been well acquainted with the tribes of
        the Goths, the most easterly of the Teutonic nations who lay along
        the imperial border. All through the third century they had been
        molesting the provinces of the Balkan Peninsula by their incessant
        raids, as we have already had occasion to relate. Only after a hard
        struggle had they been rolled back across the Danube, and compelled
        to limit their settlements to its northern bank, in what had once
        been the land of the Dacians. The last struggle with them had been in
        the time of Constantine, who, in a war that lasted from <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 328 to <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 332, had beaten them in
        the open field, compelled their king to give his sons as hostages,
        and dictated his own terms of peace. Since then the appetite of the
        Goths for war and adventure seemed <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> permanently checked: for forty years they had
        kept comparatively quiet and seldom indulged in raids across the
        Danube. They were rapidly settling down into steady farmers in the
        fertile lands on the Theiss and the Pruth; they traded freely with
        the Roman towns of Moesia; many of their young warriors enlisted
        among the Roman auxiliary troops, and one considerable body of Gothic
        emigrants had been permitted to settle as subjects of the empire on
        the northern slope of the Balkans. By this time many of the Goths
        were becoming Christians: priests of their own blood already
        ministered to them, and the Bible, translated into their own
        language, was already in their hands. One of the earliest Gothic
        converts, the good Bishop Ulfilas—the first bishop of German blood
        that was ever consecrated—had rendered into their idiom the New
        Testament and most of the Old. A great portion of his work still
        survives, incomparably the most precious relic of the old Teutonic
        tongues that we now possess.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Goths were
        rapidly losing their ancient ferocity. Compared to the barbarians who
        dwelt beyond them, they might almost be called a civilized race. The
        Romans were beginning to look upon them as a guard set on the
        frontier to ward off the wilder peoples that lay to their north and
        east. The nation was now divided into two tribes: the Visigoths,
        whose tribal name was the Thervings, lay more to the south, in what
        are now the countries of Moldavia, Wallachia, and Southern Hungary;
        the Ostrogoths, or tribe of the Gruthungs, lay more to the north and
        east, in Bessarabia, Transylvania, and the Dniester
        valley.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg
        035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a totally
        unexpected series of events were now to show how prescient
        Constantine had been, in rearing his great fortress-capital to serve
        as the central place of arms of the Balkan Peninsula.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About the year
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 372 the Huns, an
        enormous Tartar horde from beyond the Don and Volga, burst into the
        lands north of the Euxine, and began to work their way westward. The
        first tribe that lay in their way, the nomadic race of the Alans,
        they almost exterminated. Then they fell upon the Goths. The
        Ostrogoths made a desperate attempt to defend the line of the
        Dniester against the oncoming savages—<span class="tei tei-q">“men
        with faces that can hardly be called faces—rather shapeless black
        collops of flesh with little points instead of eyes; little in
        stature, but lithe and active, skilful in riding, broad shouldered,
        good at the bow, stiff-necked and proud, hiding under a barely human
        form the ferocity of the wild beast.”</span> But the enemy whom the
        Gothic historian describes in these uninviting terms was too strong
        for the Teutons of the East. The Ostrogoths were crushed and
        compelled to become vassals of the Huns, save a remnant who fought
        their way southward to the Wallachian shore, near the marshes of the
        Delta of the Danube. Then the Huns fell on the Visigoths. The wave of
        invasion pressed on; the Bug and the Pruth proved no barrier to the
        swarms of nomad bowmen, and the Visigoths, under their Duke
        Fritigern, fell back in dismay with their wives and children, their
        waggons and flocks and herds, till they found themselves with their
        backs to the Danube. Surrender to the enemy was more dreadful to the
        Visigoths than to their eastern <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> brethren; they were more civilized, most of
        them were Christians, and the prospect of slavery to savages seems to
        have appeared intolerable to them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pressed against
        the Danube and the Roman border, the Visigoths sent in despair to ask
        permission to cross from the Emperor. A contemporary writer describes
        how they stood. <span class="tei tei-q">“All the multitude that had
        escaped from the murderous savagery of the Huns—no less than 200,000
        fighting men, besides women and old men and children—-were there on
        the river bank, stretching out their hands with loud lamentations,
        and earnestly supplicating leave to cross, bewailing their calamity,
        and promising that they would ever faithfully adhere to the imperial
        alliance if only the boon was granted them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this moment
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 376) the Roman Empire
        was again divided. The house of Constantine was gone, and the East
        was ruled by Valens, a stupid, cowardly, and avaricious prince, who
        had obtained the diadem and half the Roman world only because he was
        the brother of Valentinian, the greatest general of the day.
        Valentinian had taken the West for his portion, and dwelt in his camp
        on the Rhine and Upper Danube, while Valens, slothful and timid, shut
        himself up with a court of slaves and flatterers in the imperial
        palace at Constantinople.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proposal of
        the Goths filled Valens with dismay. It was difficult to say which
        was more dangerous—to refuse a passage to 200,000 desperate men with
        arms in their hands and a savage foe at their backs, or to admit them
        within the line of river and fortress that protected the border, with
        an implied <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg
        037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        obligation to find land for them. After much doubting he chose the
        latter alternative: if the Goths would give hostages and surrender
        their arms, they should be ferried across the Danube and permitted to
        settle as subject-allies within the empire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Goths accepted
        the terms, gave up the sons of their chiefs as hostages, and streamed
        across the river as fast as the Roman Danube-flotilla could transport
        them. But no sooner had they reached Moesia than troubles broke out.
        The Roman officials at first tried to disarm the immigrants, but the
        Goths were unwilling to surrender their weapons, and offered large
        bribes to be allowed to retain them: in strict disobedience to the
        Emperor's orders, the bribes were accepted and the Goths retained
        their arms. Further disputes soon broke out. The provisions of Moesia
        did not suffice for so many hundred thousand mouths as had just
        entered its border, and Valens had ordered stores of corn from Asia
        to be collected for the use of the Goths, till they should have
        received and commenced to cultivate land of their own. But the
        governor, Lupicinus, to fill his own pockets, held back the food, and
        doled out what he chose to give at exorbitant prices. In sheer hunger
        the Goths were driven to barter a slave for a single loaf of bread
        and ten pounds of silver for a sheep. This shameless extortion
        continued as long as the stores and the patience of the Goths lasted.
        At last the poorer immigrants were actually beginning to sell their
        own children for slaves rather than let them starve. This drove the
        Goths to desperation, and a chance affray set the whole nation in a
        blaze. Fritigern, with many <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg
        038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        his nobles, was dining with Count Lupicinus at the town of
        Marcianopolis, when some starving Goths tried to pillage the market
        by force. A party of Roman soldiers strove to drive them off, and
        were at once mishandled or slain. On hearing the tumult and learning
        its cause, Lupicinus recklessly bade his retinue seize and slay
        Fritigern and the other guests at his banquet. The Goths drew their
        swords and cut their way out of the palace. Then riding to the
        nearest camp of his followers, Fritigern told his tale, and bade them
        take up arms against Rome.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There followed a
        year of desperate fighting all along the Danube, and the northern
        slope of the Balkans. The Goths half-starved for many months, and
        smarting under the extortion and chicanery to which they had been
        subjected, soon showed that the old barbarian spirit was but thinly
        covered by the veneer of Christianity and civilization which they had
        acquired in the last half-century. The struggle resolved itself into
        a repetition of the great raids of the third century: towns were
        sacked and the open country harried in the old style, nor was the war
        rendered less fierce by the fact that many runaway slaves and other
        outcasts among the provincial population joined the invaders. But the
        Roman armies still retained their old reputation; the ravages of the
        Goths were checked at the Balkans, and though joined by the remnants
        of the Ostrogoths from the Danube mouth, as well as by other tribes
        flying from the Huns, the Visigoths were at first held at bay by the
        imperial armies. A desperate pitched battle at Ad Salices, near the
        modern Kustendje thinned the ranks of both sides, but led to no
        decisive result.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next year,
        however, the unwarlike Emperor, driven into the field by the clamours
        of his subjects, took the field in person, with great reinforcements
        brought from Asia Minor. At the same time his nephew Gratian, a
        gallant young prince who had succeeded to the Empire of the West, set
        forth through Pannonia to bring aid to the lands of the Lower
        Danube.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The personal
        intervention of Valens in the struggle was followed by a fearful
        disaster. In 378 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, the main body of the
        Goths succeeded in forcing the line of the Balkans; they were not far
        from Adrianople when the Emperor started to attack them, with a
        splendid army of 60,000 men. Every one expected to hear of a victory,
        for the reputation of invincibility still clung to the legions, and
        after six hundred years of war the disciplined infantry of Rome,
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">robur peditum</span></span>, whose day had
        lasted since the Punic wars, were still reckoned superior, when
        fairly handled, to any amount of wild barbarians.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a new chapter
        of the history of the art of war was just commencing; during their
        sojourn in the plains of South Russia and Roumania the Goths had
        taken, first of all German races, to fighting on horseback. Dwelling
        in the Ukraine they had felt the influence of that land, ever the
        nurse of cavalry from the day of the Scythian to that of the Tartar
        and Cossack. They had come to <span class="tei tei-q">“consider it
        more honourable to fight on horse than on foot,”</span> and every
        chief was followed by his war-band of mounted men. Driven against
        their will into conflict with the empire, they found themselves face
        to face into the army that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg
        040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> had
        so long held the world in fear, and had turned back their own
        ancestors in rout three generations before.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Valens found the
        main body of the Goths encamped in a great <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“laager,”</span> on the plain north of Adrianople. After
        some abortive negotiations he developed an attack on their front,
        when suddenly a great body of horsemen charged in on the Roman flank.
        It was the main strength of the Gothic cavalry, which had been
        foraging at a distance; receiving news of the fight it had ridden
        straight for the battle field. Some Roman squadrons which covered the
        left flank of the Emperor's army were ridden down and trampled under
        foot. Then the Goths swept down on the infantry of the left wing,
        rolled it up, and drove it in upon the centre. So tremendous was
        their impact that legions and cohorts were pushed together in
        hopeless confusion. Every attempt to stand firm failed, and in a few
        minutes left, centre, and reserve, were one undistinguishable mass.
        Imperial guards, light troops, lancers, auxiliaries, and infantry of
        the line were wedged together in a press that grew closer every
        moment. The Roman cavalry saw that the day was lost, and rode off
        without another effort. Then the abandoned infantry realized the
        horror of their position: equally unable to deploy or to fly, they
        had to stand to be cut down. Men could not raise their arms to strike
        a blow, so closely were they packed; spears snapped right and left,
        their bearers being unable to lift them to a vertical position; many
        soldiers were stifled in the press. Into this quivering mass the
        Goths rode, plying lance and sword against <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the helpless enemy. It was not till forty
        thousand men had fallen that the thinning of the ranks enabled the
        survivors to break out and follow their cavalry in a headlong flight.
        They left behind them, dead on the field, the Emperor, the Grand
        Masters of the Infantry and Cavalry, the Count of the Palace, and
        thirty-five commanders of different corps.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The battle of
        Adrianople was the most fearful defeat suffered by a Roman army since
        Cannæ, a slaughter to which it is aptly compared by the contemporary
        historian Ammianus Marcellinus. The army of the East was almost
        annihilated, and was never reorganized again on the old Roman
        lines.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This awful
        catastrophe brought down on Constantinople the first attack which it
        experienced since it had changed its name from Byzantium. After a
        vain assault on Adrianople, the victorious Goths pressed rapidly on
        towards the imperial city. Harrying the whole country side as they
        passed by, they presented themselves before the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Golden Gate,”</span> its south-western exit. But the
        attack was destined to come to nothing: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“their courage failed them when they looked on the vast
        circuit of walls and the enormous extent of streets; all that mass of
        riches within appeared inaccessible to them. They cast away the siege
        machines which they had prepared, and rolled backward on to
        Thrace.”</span><a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href=
        "#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> Beyond
        skirmishing under the walls with a body of Saracen cavalry which had
        been brought up to strengthen the garrison, they made no hostile
        attempt on the city. So forty years after his death, Constantine's
        prescience was for the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg
        042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        first time justified. He was right in believing that an impregnable
        city on the Bosphorus would prove the salvation of the Balkan
        Peninsula even if all its open country were overrun by the
        invader.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The unlucky Valens
        was succeeded on the throne by Theodosius, a wise and virtuous
        prince, who set himself to repair, by caution and courage combined,
        the disaster that had shaken the Roman power in the Danube lands.
        With the remnants of the army of the East he made head against the
        barbarians; without venturing to attack their main body, he destroyed
        many marauders and scattered bands, and made the continuance of the
        war profitless to them. If they dispersed to plunder they were cut
        off; if they held together in masses they starved. Presently
        Fritigern died, and Theodosius made peace with his successor
        Athanarich, a king who had lately come over the Danube at the head of
        a new swarm of Goths from the Carpathian country. Theodosius frankly
        promised and faithfully observed the terms that Fritigern had asked
        of Valens ten years before. He granted the Goths land for their
        settlement in the Thracian province which they had wasted, and
        enlisted in his armies all the chiefs and their war-bands. Within ten
        years after the fight of Adrianople he had forty thousand Teutonic
        horsemen in his service; they formed the best and most formidable
        part of his host, and were granted a higher pay than the native Roman
        soldiery. The immediate military results of the policy of Theodosius
        were not unsatisfactory; it was his Gothic auxiliaries who won for
        him his two great victories over the legions of the West, when in
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But from the
        political side the experiment of Theodosius was fraught with the
        greatest danger that the Roman Empire had yet known. When barbarian
        auxiliaries had been enlisted before, they had been placed under
        Roman leaders and mixed with equal numbers of Roman troops. To leave
        them under their own chiefs, and deliberately favour them at the
        expense of the native soldiery, was a most unhappy experiment. It
        practically put the command of the empire in their hands; for there
        was no hold over them save their personal loyalty to Theodosius, and
        the spell which the grandeur of the Roman name and Roman culture
        still exercised over their minds. That spell was still strong, as is
        shown in the story which the Gothic historian Jornandes tells about
        the visit of the old King Athanarich to Constantinople. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“When he entered the royal city, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Now,’</span> said he, <span class="tei tei-q">‘do I at

        passed his eyes hither and thither admiring first the site of the
        city, then the fleets of corn-ships, then the lofty walls, then the
        crowds of people of all nations, mingled as the waters from divers
        springs mix in a single pool, then the ranks of disciplined soldiery.
        And at last he cried aloud, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Doubtless the
        Emperor is as a god on earth, and he who raises a hand against him is
        guilty of his own blood.’</span> ”</span> But this impression was not
        to continue for long. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        Theodosius, <span class="tei tei-q">“the lover of peace and of the

        weakly sons Arcadius and Honorius.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Roman Empire,
        at the end of the fourth century, was in a condition which made the
        experiment of Theodosius particularly dangerous. The government was
        highly centralized and bureaucratic; hosts of officials, appointed
        directly from Constantinople, administered every provincial post from
        the greatest to the least. There was little local self-government and
        no local patriotism. The civil population was looked on by the
        bureaucratic caste as a multitude without rights or capacities,
        existing solely for the purpose of paying taxes. So strongly was this
        view held, that to prevent the revenue from suffering, the
        land-holding classes, from the <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">curialis</span></span>, or local magnate, down
        to the poorest peasant, were actually forbidden to move from one
        district to another without special permission. A landowner was even
        prohibited from enlisting in the army, unless he could show that he
        left an heir behind him capable of paying his share in the local
        rates. An almost entire separation existed between the civil
        population and the military caste; it was hard for a civilian of any
        position to enlist; only the lower classes—who <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> were of no account in tax-paying—were
        suffered to join the army. On the other hand, every pressure was used
        to make the sons of soldiers continue in the service. Thus had arisen
        a purely professional army, which had no sympathy or connection with
        the unarmed provincials whom it protected.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The army had been
        a source of unending trouble in the third century; for a hundred
        years it had made and unmade Cæsars at its pleasure. That was while
        it was still mainly composed of men born within the empire, and
        officered by Romans.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Theodosius had
        now swamped the native element in the army by his wholesale
        enlistment of Gothic war-bands. And he had, moreover, handed many of
        the chief military posts to Teutons. Some of them indeed had married
        Roman wives and taken kindly to Roman modes of life, while nearly all
        had professed Christianity. But at the best they were military
        adventurers of alien blood while at the worst they were liable to
        relapse into barbarism, cast all their loyalty and civilization to
        the winds, and take to harrying the empire again in the old fearless
        fashion of the third century. Clearly nothing could be more dangerous
        than to hand over the protection of the timid and unarmed civil
        population to such guardians. The contempt they must have felt for
        the unwarlike provincials was so great, and the temptation to plunder
        the wealthy cities of the empire so constant and pressing, that it is
        no wonder if the Teutons yielded. Cæsar-making seemed as easy to the
        leaders as the sack of provincial churches and treasuries did to the
        rank and file.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg
        047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the personal
        ascendency of Theodosius was removed, the empire fell at once into
        the troubles which were inevitable. Both at the court of Arcadius,
        who reigned at Constantinople, and at that of Honorius, who had
        received the West as his share, a war of factions commenced between
        the German and the Roman party. Theodosius had distributed so many
        high military posts to Goths and other Teutons, that this influence
        was almost unbounded. Stilicho <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Magister militum</span></span>
        (commander-in-chief) of the armies of Italy was predominant at the
        council board of Honorius; though he was a pure barbarian by blood,
        Theodosius had married him to his own niece Serena, and left him
        practically supreme in the West, for the young emperor was aged only
        eleven. In the East Arcadius, the elder brother, had attained his
        eighteenth year, and might have ruled his own realm had he possessed
        the energy. But he was a witless young man, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“short, thin, and sallow, so inactive that he seldom
        spoke, and always looked as if he was about to fall asleep.”</span>
        His prime minister was a Western Roman named Rufinus, but before the
        first year of his reign was over, a Gothic captain named Gainas slew
        Rufinus at a review, before the Emperor's very eyes. The weak
        Arcadius was then compelled to make the eunuch Eutropius his
        minister, and to appoint Gainas <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Magister militum</span></span> for the East.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gainas and
        Stilicho contented themselves with wire-pulling at Court; but another
        Teutonic leader thought that the time had come for bolder work.
        Alaric was a chief sprung from the family of the Balts, whom the
        Goths reckoned next to the god-descended <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Amals among their princely houses. He was
        young, daring, and untameable; several years spent at Constantinople
        had failed to civilize him, but had succeeded in filling him with
        contempt for Roman effeminacy. Soon after the death of Theodosius, he
        raised the Visigoths in revolt, making it his pretext that the
        advisers of Arcadius were refusing the <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">foederati</span></span>, or auxiliaries, certain
        arrears of pay. The Teutonic sojourners in Moesia and Thrace joined
        him almost to a man, and the Constantinopolitan government found
        itself with only a shadow of an army to oppose the rebels. Alaric
        wandered far and wide, from the Danube to the gates of
        Constantinople, and from Constantinople to Greece, ransoming or
        sacking every town in his way till the Goths were gorged with
        plunder. No one withstood him save Stilicho, who was summoned from
        the West to aid his master's brother. By skilful manœuvres Stilicho
        blockaded Alaric in a mountain position in Arcadia; but when he had
        him at his mercy, it was found that <span class="tei tei-q">“dog does
        not eat dog.”</span> The Teutonic prime minister let the Teutonic
        rebel escape him, and the Visigoths rolled north again into
        Illyricum. Sated with plunder, Alaric then consented to grant
        Arcadius peace, on condition that he was made a <span lang="la"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Magister militum</span></span> like Stilicho and
        Gainas, and granted as much land for his tribesmen as he chose to
        ask. [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 396.]</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the next five
        years Alaric, now proclaimed King of the Goths by his victorious
        soldiery, reigned with undisputed sway over the eastern parts of the
        Balkan Peninsula, paying only a shadow of homage to the royal phantom
        at Constantinople. There <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg
        049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        appeared every reason to believe that a German kingdom was about to
        be permanently established in the lands south and west of the Danube.
        The fate which actually befell Gaul, Spain, and Britain, a few years
        later seemed destined for Moesia and Macedonia. How different the
        history of Europe would have been if the Germans had settled down in
        Servia and Bulgaria we need hardly point out.</p>

        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 401, Alaric, instead of
        resuming his attacks on Constantinople, suddenly declared war on the
        Western Emperor Honorius. He marched round the head of the Adriatic
        and invaded Northern Italy. The half-Romanized Stilicho, who wished
        to keep the rule of the West to himself, fought hard to turn the
        Goths out of Italy, and beat back Alaric's first invasion. But then
        the young emperor, who was as weak and more worthless than his
        brother Arcadius, slew the great minister on a charge of treason.
        When Stilicho was gone, Alaric had everything his own way; he moved
        with the whole Visigothic race into Italy, where he ranged about at
        his will, ransoming and plundering every town from Rome downwards.
        The Visigoths are heard of no more in the Balkan Peninsula; they now
        pass into the history of Italy and then into that of Spain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Alaric's
        eyes were turned on Italy, but before he had actually come into
        conflict with Stilicho, the Court of Constantinople had been the seat
        of grave troubles. Gainas the Gothic <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Magister militum</span></span> of the East, and
        his creature, the eunuch Eutropius, had fallen out, and the man of
        war had no <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg

        difficulty in disposing of the wretched harem-bred Grand Chamberlain.
        Instigated by Gainas, the German mercenaries in the army of Asia
        started an insurrection under a certain Tribigild. Gainas was told to
        march against them, and collected troops ostensibly for that purpose.
        But when he was at the head of a considerable army, he did not attack
        the rebels, but sent a message to Constantinople bidding Arcadius
        give up to him the obnoxious Grand Chamberlain. Eutropius, hearing of
        his danger, threw himself on the protection of the Church: he fled
        into the Cathedral of St. Sophia and clung to the altar. John
        Chrysostom, the intrepid Patriarch of Constantinople, forbade the
        soldiers to enter the church, and protected the fugitive for some
        days. One of the most striking incidents in the history of St. Sophia
        followed: while the cowering Chamberlain lay before the altar, John
        preached to a crowded congregation a sermon on the text, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Vanity of vanities, all is vanity,”</span> emphasizing
        every period of his harangue by pointing to the fallen
        Eutropius—prime minister of the empire yesterday, and a hunted
        criminal to-day. The patriarch extorted a promise that the eunuch's
        life should be spared, and Eutropius gave himself up. Arcadius
        banished him to Cyprus, but the inexorable Gainas was not contented
        with his rival's removal; he had Eutropius brought back to
        Constantinople and beheaded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span lang=
        "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Magister militum</span></span> now brought his
        army over to Constantinople, and quartered it there to overawe the
        emperor. It appeared quite likely that ere long the Germans would
        sack the city; but the fate that <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> befell Rome ten years later was not destined
        for Constantinople. A mere chance brawl put the domination of Gainas
        to a sudden end. He himself and many of his troops were outside the
        city, when a sudden quarrel at one of the gates between a band of
        Goths and some riotous citizens brought about a general outbreak
        against the Germans. The Constantinopolitan mob showed itself more
        courageous and not less unruly than the Roman mob of elder days. The
        whole population turned out with extemporized arms and attacked the
        German soldiery. The gates were closed to prevent Gainas and his
        troops from outside returning, and a desperate street-fight ranged
        over the entire city. Isolated bodies of the Germans were cut off one
        by one, and at last their barracks were surrounded and set on fire.
        The rioters had the upper hand; seven thousand soldiers fell, and the
        remnant thought themselves lucky to escape. Gainas at once declared
        open war on the empire, but he had not the genius of Alaric, nor the
        numerical strength that had followed the younger chief. He was beaten
        in the field and forced to fly across the Danube, where he was caught
        and beheaded by Uldes, King of the Huns. Curiously enough the officer
        who defeated Gainas was himself not only a Goth but a heathen: he was
        named Fravitta and had been the sworn guest-friend of Theodosius,
        whose son he faithfully defended even against the assault of his own
        countrymen, [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 401.]</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The departure of
        Alaric and the death of Gainas freed the Eastern Romans from the
        double danger that has impended over them. They were neither

        id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to see an independent German
        kingdom on the Danube and Morava, nor to remain under the rule of a
        semi-civilized German <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Magister
        militum</span></span>, making and unmaking ministers, and perhaps
        Cæsars, at his good pleasure. The weak Arcadius was enabled to spend
        the remaining seven years of his life in comparative peace and quiet.
        His court was only troubled by an open war between his spouse, the
        Empress Ælia Eudoxia, and John Chrysostom, the Patriarch of
        Constantinople. John was a man of saintly life and apostolic fervour,
        but rash and inconsiderate alike in speech and action. His charity
        and eloquence made him the idol of the populace of the imperial city,
        but his austere manners and autocratic methods of dealing with his
        subordinates had made him many foes among the clergy. The patriarch's
        enemies were secretly supported by the empress, who had taken offence
        at the outspoken way in which John habitually denounced the luxury
        and insolence of her court. She favoured the intrigues of Theophilus,
        Patriarch of Alexandria, against his brother prelate, backed the
        Asiatic clergy in their complaints about John's oppression of them,
        and at last induced the Emperor to allow the saintly patriarch to be
        deposed by a hastily-summoned council, the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Synod of the Oak”</span> held outside the city. The
        populace rose at once to defend their pastor; riots broke out,
        Theodosius was chased back to Egypt, and the Emperor, terrified by an
        earthquake which seemed to manifest the wrath of heaven, restored
        John to his place.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next year,
        however, the war between the empress and the patriarch broke out
        again. John took the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg
        053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        occasion of the erection of a statue of Eudoxia in the Augustaeum to
        recommence his polemics. Some obsolete semi-pagan ceremonies at its
        dedication roused his wrath, and he delivered a scathing sermon in
        which—if his enemies are to be believed—he compared the empress to
        Herodias, and himself to John the Baptist. The Emperor, at his wife's
        demand, summoned another council, which condemned Chrysostom, and on
        Easter Day, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 404, seized the
        patriarch in his cathedral by armed force, and banished him to Asia.
        That night a fire, probably kindled by the angry adherents of
        Chrysostom, broke out in St. Sophia, which was burnt to the ground.
        From thence it spread to the neighbouring buildings, and finally to
        the Senate-house, which was consumed with all the treasures of
        ancient Greek art of which Constantine had made it the
        repository.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the
        exiled John was banished to a dreary mountain fastness in Cappadocia,
        and afterwards condemned to a still more remote prison at Pityus on
        the Euxine. He died on his way thither, leaving a wonderful
        reputation for patience and cheerfulness under affliction. This
        fifth-century Becket was well-nigh the only patriarch of
        Constantinople who ever fell out with the imperial Court on a
        question of morals as distinguished from dogma. Chrysostom's quarrel
        was with the luxury, insolence, and frivolity of the Empress and her
        Court; no real ecclesiastical question was involved in his
        deposition, for the charges against him were mere pretexts to cover
        the hatred of his disloyal clergy and the revenge of the insulted
        Aelia Eudoxia. [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        inert Arcadius died in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 408, at the early age
        of thirty-one; his imperious consort had preceded him to the grave,
        and the empire of the East was left to Theodosius II., a child of
        seven years, their only son. There was hardly an instance in Roman
        history of a minor succeeding quietly to his father's throne. An
        ambitious relative or a disloyal general had habitually supplanted
        the helpless heir. But the ministers of Arcadius were exceptionally
        virtuous or exceptionally destitute of ambition. The little emperor
        was duly crowned, and the administration of the East undertaken in
        his name by the able Anthemius, who held the office of Praetorian
        Praefect. History relates nothing but good of this minister; he made
        a wise commercial treaty with the king of Persia; he repelled with
        ease a Hunnish invasion of Moesia; he built a flotilla on the Danube,
        where Roman warships had not been seen since the death of Valens,
        forty years before; he reorganized the corn supply <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Constantinople; and did much to get
        back into order and cultivation the desolated north-western lands of
        the Balkan Peninsula, from which Alaric and his Visigothic hordes had
        now taken their final departure. The empire was still more indebted
        to him for bringing up the young Theodosius as an honest and
        god-fearing man. The palace under Anthemius' rule was the school of
        the virtues: the lives of the emperor and his three sisters,
        Pulcheria, Arcadia, and Marina, were the model and the marvel of
        their subjects. Theodosius inherited the piety and honesty of his
        grandfather and namesake, but was a youth of slender capacity, though
        he took some interest in literature, and was renowned for his
        beautiful penmanship. His eldest sister, Pulcheria, was the ruling
        spirit of the family, and possessed unlimited influence over him,
        though she was but two years his senior. When Anthemius died in
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 414, she took the title
        of Augusta, and assumed the regency of the East. Pulcheria was an
        extraordinary woman: on gathering up the reins of power she took a
        vow of chastity, and lived as a crowned nun for thirty-six years; her
        fear had been that, if she married, her husband might cherish
        ambitious schemes against her brother's crown; she therefore kept
        single herself and persuaded her sisters to make a similar vow.
        Austere, indefatigable, and unselfish, she proved equal to ruling the
        realms of the East with success, though no woman had ever made the
        attempt before.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Theodosius
        came of age he refused to remove his sister from power, and treated
        her as his colleague and equal. By her advice he married in

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> 421, the year that he came of age, the
        beautiful and accomplished Athenaïs, daughter of the philosopher
        Leontius. The emperor's chosen spouse had been brought up as a pagan,
        but was converted before her marriage, and baptized by the name of
        Eudocia. She displayed her literary tastes in writing religious
        poetry, which had some merit, according to the critics of the
        succeeding age. The austere Pulcheria—always immersed in state
        business or occupied in religious observances—found herself ere long
        ill at ease in the company of the lively, beautiful, and volatile
        literary lady whom she had chosen as sister-in-law. If Theodosius had
        been less easy-going and good-hearted he must have sent away either
        his sister or his wife, but he long contrived to dwell affectionately
        with both, though their bickerings were unending. After many years of
        married life, however, a final quarrel came, and the empress retired
        to spend the last years of her life in seclusion at Jerusalem. The
        cause of her exile is not really known: we have only a wild story
        concerning it, which finds an exact parallel in one of the tales of
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“Arabian Nights.”</span></p>

          received it, recognized it and concealed it, and called his wife

          him as a love-gift; for he was a very handsome man. And on this
          account he put Paulinus to death, but he permitted Eudocia to go to

        executed, and that Eudocia spent her last years of retirement in
        Palestine, we know for certain. All the rest of the story is in
        reality hidden from us. The chief improbability of the tale is that
        Eudocia had reached the age of forty when the breach between her and
        her husband took place, and that Paulinus was also an official of
        mature years.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Theodosius' long
        reign passed by in comparative quiet. Its only serious troubles were
        a short war with the Persians, and a longer one with Attila, the
        great king of the Huns, whose empire now stretched over all the lands
        north of the Black Sea and Danube, where the Goths had once dwelt. In
        this struggle the Roman armies were almost invariably unfortunate.
        The Huns ravaged the country as far as Adrianople and Philippopolis,
        and had to be bought off by the annual payment of 700 lbs. of gold
        [£31,000]. It is true that they fell on Theodosius while his main
        force was engaged on the Persian frontier, but the constant
        ill-success of the imperial generals seems to show that the armies of
        the East had never been properly reorganized since the military
        system of Theodosius I. had been broken up by the revolt of Gainas
        forty years before. His grandson had neither a trustworthy body of

        successor, not his young-son-in-law, a cruel and profligate prince,
        but his sister Pulcheria, who at the same time ended her vow of
        celibacy and married Marcianus, a veteran soldier and a prominent
        member of the Senate. The marriage was but formal, for both were now
        well advanced in years: as a political expedient it was all that
        could be desired. The empire had peace and prosperity under their
        rule, and freed itself from the ignominious tribute to the Huns.
        Before Attila died in 452, he had met and been checked by the

        as generals; all ascended the throne at a ripe age; not one of them
        won his crown by arms, all were peaceably designated either by their
        predecessors, or by the Senate and army. These princes were Leo I.
        (457-474), Zeno (474-491), Anastasius (491-518). Their chief merit
        was that they guided the Roman Empire in the East safely through the
        stormy times which saw its extinction in the West. While, beyond the
        Adriatic, province after province was being lopped <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> off and formed into a new Germanic
        kingdom, the emperors who reigned at Constantinople kept a tight grip
        on the Balkan Peninsula and on Asia, and succeeded in maintaining
        their realm absolutely intact. Both East and West were equally
        exposed to the barbarian in the fifth century, and the difference of
        their fate came from the character of their rulers, not from the
        diversity of their political conditions. In the West, after the
        extinction of the house of Theodosius (455 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>), the emperors were
        ephemeral puppets, made and unmade by the generals of their armies,
        who were invariably Germans. The two <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Magistri militum</span></span>, Ricimer and
        Gundovald—one Suabian, the other Burgundian by birth—deposed or slew
        no less than five of their nominal masters in seventeen years. In the
        East, on the other hand, it was the emperors who destroyed one after
        another the ambitious generals, who, by arms or intrigue, threatened
        their throne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While this
        comparison bears witness to the personal ability of the three
        emperors who ruled at Constantinople between <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 457 and <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 518, it is only fair to
        remember they were greatly helped by the fact that the German element
        in their armies had never reached the pitch of power to which it had
        attained in the West; the suppression of Gainas forty years before
        had saved them from that danger. But unruly and aspiring generals
        were not wanting in the East; the greatest danger of Leo I. was the
        conspiracy of the great <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Magister
        militum</span></span> Aspar, whom he detected and slew when he was on
        the eve of rebelling. Zeno was once chased out of his capital by
        rebels, and twice <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg
        061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        vexed by dangerous risings in Asia Minor, but on each occasion he
        triumphed over his adversaries, and celebrated his victory by the
        execution of the leaders of the revolt. Anastasius was vexed for
        several years by the raids of a certain Count Vitalian, who ranged
        over the Thracian provinces with armies recruited from the barbarians
        beyond the Danube. But, in spite of all these rebellions, the empire
        was never in serious danger of sinking into disorder or breaking up,
        as the Western realm had done, into new un-Roman kingdoms. So far was
        it from this fate, that Anastasius left his successor, when he died
        in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 518, a loyal army of
        150,000 men, a treasure of 320,000 lbs. of gold, and an unbroken
        frontier to East and West.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The main secret of
        the success of the emperors of the fifth century in holding their own
        came from the fact that they had reorganized their armies, and filled
        them up with native troops in great numbers. Leo I. was the first
        ruler who utilized the military virtues of the Isaurians, or mountain
        populations of Southern Asia Minor. He added several regiments of
        them to the army of the East, but it was his son-in-law and
        successor, Zeno, himself an Isaurian born, who developed the scheme.
        He raised an imperial guard from his countrymen, and enlisted as many
        corps of them as could be raised; moreover, he formed regiments of
        Armenians and other inhabitants of the Roman frontier of the East,
        and handed over to his successor, Anastasius, an army in which the
        barbarian auxiliaries—now composed of Teutons and Huns in about equal
        numbers—were decidedly dominated by the native
        elements.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last danger
        which the Eastern Empire was to experience from the hands of the
        Germans fell into the reign of Zeno. The Ostrogoths had submitted to
        the Huns ninety years before, when their brethren the Visigoths fled
        into Roman territory, in the reign of Valens. But when the Hunnish
        Empire broke up at the death of Attila [<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 452], the Ostrogoths
        freed themselves, and replaced their late masters as the main danger
        on the Danube. The bulk of them streamed south-westward, and settled
        in Pannonia, the border-province of the Western Empire, on the
        frontier of the East-Roman districts of Dacia and Moesia. They soon
        fell out with Zeno, and two Ostrogothic chiefs, Theodoric, the son of
        Theodemir, and Theodoric, the son of Triarius, were the scourges of
        the Balkan Peninsula for more than twenty years. While the bulk of
        their tribesmen settled down on the banks of the Save and Mid-Danube,
        the two Theodorics harried the whole of Macedonia and Moesia by
        never-ending raids. Zeno tried to turn them against each other,
        offering first to the one, then to the other, the title of
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Magister militum</span></span>, and a large
        pension. But now—as in the time of Alaric and Stilicho—it was seen
        that <span class="tei tei-q">“dog will not eat dog”</span>; the two
        Theodorics, after quarrelling for a while, banded themselves together
        against Zeno. The story of their reconciliation is curious.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Theodoric, the son
        of Theodemir, the ally of Rome for the moment, had surrounded his
        rival on a rocky hill in a defile of the Balkans. While they lay
        opposite each other, Theodoric, the son of Triarius [he is usually
        known as Theodoric the One-Eyed], <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> rode down to his enemy's lines and called to
        him, <span class="tei tei-q">“Madman, betrayer of your race, do you
        not see that the Roman plan is always to destroy Goths by Goths?
        Whichever of us fails, they, not we, will be the stronger. They never
        give you real help, but send you out against me to perish here in the
        Desert.”</span> Then all the Goths cried out, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The One-Eyed is right. These men are Goths like
        ourselves.”</span> So the two Theodorics made peace, and Zeno had to
        cope with them both at once [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 479]. Two years later
        Theodoric the One-Eyed was slain by accident—his horse flung him, as
        he mounted, against a spear fixed by the door of his tent—but his
        namesake continued a thorn in the side of the empire till 488
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In that year Zeno
        bethought him of a device for ridding himself of the Ostrogoth, who,
        though he made no permanent settlement in Moesia or Macedonia, was
        gradually depopulating the realm by his incursions. The line of
        ephemeral emperors who reigned in Italy over the shrunken Western
        realm had ended in 476, when the German general Odoacer deposed
        Romulus Augustulus, and did not trouble himself to nominate another
        puppet-Cæsar to succeed him. By his order a deputation from the Roman
        Senate visited Zeno at Constantinople, to inform him that they did
        not require an emperor of their own to govern Italy, but would
        acknowledge him as ruler alike of East and West; at the same time
        they besought Zeno to nominate, as his representative in the Italian
        lands, their defender, the great Odoacer. Zeno replied by advising
        the Romans to persuade Odoacer to recognize as his lord Julius Nepos,
        one of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg
        064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        dethroned nominees of Ricimer, who had survived his loss of the
        imperial diadem. Odoacer refused, and proclaimed himself king in
        Italy, while still affecting—against Zeno's own will—to recognize the
        Constantinopolitan emperor as his suzerain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 488
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> it occurred to Zeno to
        offer Theodoric the government of Italy, if he would conquer it from
        Odoacer. The Ostrogoth, who had harried the inland of the Balkan
        Peninsula bare, and had met several reverses of late from the Roman
        arms, took the offer. He was made <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“patrician”</span> and consul, and started off with all
        the Ostrogothic nation at his back to win the realm of Italy. After
        hard fighting with Odoacer and the mixed multitude of mercenaries
        that followed him, the Goths conquered Italy, and Theodoric—German
        king and Roman patrician—began to reign at Ravenna. He always
        professed to be the vassal and deputy of the emperor at
        Constantinople, and theoretically his conquest of Italy meant the
        reunion of the East and the West. But the Western realm had shrunk
        down to Italy and Illyricum, and the power of Zeno therein was purely
        nominal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the departure
        of the Ostrogoths we have seen our last of the Germans in the Balkan
        Peninsula; after 488 the Slavs take their place as the molesters of
        the Roman frontier on the Danube.</p>

        Anastasius died in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 518 at the ripe age of
        eighty-eight, and his sceptre passed to Justinus, the commander of
        his body-guard, whom Senate and army alike hailed as most worthy to
        succeed the good old man. The late emperor had nephews, but he had
        never designated them as his heirs, and they retired into private
        life at his death. Justinus was well advanced in years, as all his
        three predecessors had been when they mounted the throne. But unlike
        Leo, Zeno, and Anastasius, he had won his way to the front in the
        army, not in the civil service. He had risen from the ranks, was a
        rough uncultured soldier, and is said to have been hardly able to
        sign his own name. His reign of nine years would have been of little
        note in history—for he made no wars and spent no treasure—if he had
        not been the means of placing on the throne of the East the greatest
        ruler since the death of Constantine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justinus had no
        children himself, but had adopted as his heir his nephew Justinian,
        son of his deceased brother Sabatius. This young man, born after his
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066"
        id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> father and uncle had won their
        way to high places in the army, was no uncultured peasant as they had
        been, but had been reared, as the heir of a wealthy house, in all the
        learning of the day. He showed from the first a keen intelligence,
        and applied himself with zeal to almost every department of civil
        life. Law, finance, administrative economy, theology, music,
        architecture, fortification, all were dear to him. The only thing in
        which he seems to have taken little personal interest was military
        matters. His uncle trusted everything to him, and finally made him
        his colleague on the throne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justinian was heir
        designate to the empire, and had passed the age of thirty-five,
        giving his contemporaries the impression that he was a staid,
        business-like, and eminently practical personage. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“No one ever remembered him young,”</span> it was said,
        and most certainly no one ever expected him to scandalize the empire
        by a sensational marriage. But in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 526 the world learnt,
        to the horror of the respectable and the joy of all scandal-mongers,
        that he had declared his intention of taking to wife the dancer
        Theodora, the star of the Byzantine comic stage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So many stories
        have gathered around Theodora's name that it is hard to say how far
        her early life had been discreditable. A libellous work called the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Secret History,”</span> written by an enemy
        of herself and her husband,<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href=
        "#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> gives us
        many scandalous details of her career; but the very virulence of the
        book makes its tales incredible. It is indisputable, however, that
        Theodora was an actress, and that Roman actresses <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> enjoyed an unenviable reputation for
        light morals. There was actually a law which forbade a member of the
        senate to marry an actress, and Justinian had to repeal it in order
        to legalize his own marriage. There had been scores of bad and
        reckless men on the throne before, but none of them had ever dared to
        commit an action which startled the world half so much as this freak
        of the staid Justinian. His own mother used every effort to turn him
        from his purpose, and his uncle the Emperor threatened to disinherit
        him: but he was quietly persistent, and ere the aged Justinus died he
        had been induced to acknowledge the marriage of his nephew, and to
        confer on Theodora the title of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Patrician.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Theodora, as even
        her enemies allow, was the most beautiful woman of her age.
        Procopius, the best historian of the day, says <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that it was impossible for mere man to describe her
        comeliness in words, or imitate it in art.”</span> All that her
        detractors could say was that she was below the middle height, and
        that her complexion was rather pale, though not unhealthy. It is
        unfortunate that we have no representation of her surviving, save the
        famous mosaic in San Vitale at Ravenna, and mosaic is of all forms of
        art that least suited to reproduce beauty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever her early
        life may have been, Theodora was in spirit and intelligence well
        suited to be the mate of the Emperor of the East. After her marriage
        no word of scandal was breathed against her life. She rose to the
        height of her situation: once her courage saved her husband's throne,
        and always she was the ablest and the most trusted of his
        councillors. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg
        069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The
        grave, studious, and hard-working Emperor never regretted his choice
        of a consort.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It cannot be said,
        however, that either Justinian or Theodora are sympathetic
        characters. The Emperor was a hard and suspicious master, and not
        over grateful to subjects who served him well; he was intolerant in
        religious, and unscrupulous in political matters. When his heart was
        set on a project he was utterly unmindful of the slaughter and ruin
        which it might bring upon his people. In the extent of his conquests
        and the magnificence of his public works, he was incomparably the
        greatest of the emperors who reigned at Constantinople. But the
        greatness was purely personal: he left the empire weaker in
        resources, if broader in provinces, than he found it. Of all the
        great sovereigns of history he may be most fairly compared with Louis
        XIV. of France; but it may be remembered to his credit in the
        comparison that Louis has nothing to set against Justinian's great
        legal work—the compilation of the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pandects</span></span>
        and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Institutes</span></span>, and that Justinian's
        private life, unlike that of the Frenchman, was strict even to
        austerity. All night long, we read, he sat alone over his State
        papers in his cabinet, or paced the dark halls in deep thought. His
        sleepless vigilance so struck his subjects that the strangest legends
        became current even in his life-time: his enemies whispered that he
        was no mere man, but an evil spirit that required no rest. One
        grotesque tale even said that the Emperor had been seen long after
        midnight traversing the corridors of his palace—without his head.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If Justinian
        seemed hardly human to those who <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> feared him, Theodora is represented as entirely
        given up to pride and ambition, never forgiving an offence, but
        hunting to death or exile all who had crossed her in the smallest
        thing. She is reproached—but who that has risen from a low estate is
        not?—of an inordinate love for the pomps and vanities of imperial
        state. High officials complained that she had as great a voice in
        settling political matters as her husband. Yet, on the whole, her
        influence would appear not to have been an evil one—historians
        acknowledge that she was liberal in almsgiving, religious after her
        own fashion, and that she often interfered to aid the oppressed. It
        is particularly recorded that, remembering the dangers of her own
        youth, she was zealous in establishing institutions for the
        reclaiming of women who had fallen into sin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The aged Justinus
        died in 527 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        the sole occupant of the throne, which he was destined to occupy for
        thirty-eight years. It was less than half the century, yet his
        personality seems to pervade the whole period, and history hardly
        remembers the insignificant predecessors and successors whose reigns
        eke out the remainder of the years between 500 and 600.</p>

        Justinian took it over from the hands of his uncle was in a more
        prosperous condition than it had known since the death of
        Constantine. Since the Ostrogoths had moved out of the Balkan
        Peninsula in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 487, it had not
        suffered from any very long or destructive invasion from without. The
        Slavonic tribes, now heard of for the first time, and the Bulgarians
        had made raids across the Danube, but <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> they had not yet shown any signs of settling
        down—as the Goths had done—within the limits of the empire. Their
        incursions, though vexatious, were not dangerous. Still the European
        provinces of the empire were in worse condition than the Asiatic, and
        were far from having recovered the effects of the ravages of
        Fritigern and Alaric, Attila, and Theodoric. But the more fortunate
        Asiatic lands had hardly seen a foreign enemy for centuries.<a id=
        "noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> Except in
        the immediate neighbourhood of the Persian frontier there was no
        danger, and Persian wars had been infrequent of late. Southern Asia
        Minor had once or twice suffered from internal risings—rebellions of
        the warlike Isaurians—but civil war left no such permanent mark on
        the land as did barbarian invasions. On the whole, the resources of
        the provinces beyond the Bosphorus were intact.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justinus in his
        quiet reign had spent little or none of the great hoard of treasure
        which Anastasius had bequeathed to him. There were more than 300,000
        lbs. of gold [£13,400,000] in store when Justinian came to the
        throne. The army, as we have had occasion to relate in the last
        chapter, was in good order, and composed in a larger proportion of
        born subjects of the empire than it had been at any time since the
        battle of Adrianople. There would appear to have been from 150,000 to
        200,000 men under arms, but the extent of the frontiers of the empire
        were so great that Justinian never sent out a single army of more
        than <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name=
        "Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> 30,000 strong, and
        forces of only a third of that number are often found entrusted with
        such mighty enterprises as the invasion of Africa or the defence of
        the Armenian border. The flower of the Roman army was no longer its
        infantry, but its mailed horsemen (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Cataphracti</span></span>), armed with lance and
        bow, as the Parthian cavalry had once been of old. The infantry
        comprised more archers and javelin-men than heavy troops: the
        Isaurians and other provincials of the mountainous parts of Asia
        Minor were reckoned the best of them. Among both horse and foot large
        bodies of foreign auxiliaries were still found: the Huns and Arabs
        supplied light cavalry, the German Herules and Gepidæ from beyond the
        Danube heavier troops.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The weakest point
        in the empire when Justinian took it over was its financial system.
        The cardinal maxim of political economy, that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“taxes should be raised in the manner least oppressive to
        those who pay them”</span> was as yet undreamt of. The exaction of
        arbitrary customs dues, and the frequent grant of monopolies was
        noxious to trade. The deplorable system of tax-farming through
        middlemen was employed in many branches of the revenue. Landed
        proprietors, small and great, were still mercilessly overtaxed, in
        consideration of their exemption from military service. The budget
        was always handicapped by the necessity for providing free corn for
        the populace of Constantinople. Yet in spite of all these drawbacks
        Justinian enjoyed an enormous and steady revenue. His finance
        minister, John of Cappadocia, was such an ingenious extortioner that
        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name=
        "Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> treasury was never
        empty in the hardest stress of war and famine: but it was kept full
        at the expense of the future. The grinding taxation of Justinian's
        reign bore fruit in the permanent impoverishment of the provinces:
        his successors were never able to raise such a revenue again. Here
        again Justinian may well be compared to Louis XIV.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justinian's policy
        divides into the departments of internal and foreign affairs. Of his
        doings as legislator, administrator, theologian, and builder, we
        shall speak in their proper place. But the history of his foreign
        policy forms the main interest of his reign. He had determined to
        take up a task which none of his predecessors since the division of
        the Empire under Arcadius and Honorius had dared to contemplate. It
        was his dream to re-unite under his sceptre the German kingdoms in
        the Western Mediterranean which had been formed out of the broken
        fragments of the realm of Honorius; and to end the solemn pretence by
        which he was nominally acknowledged as Emperor West of the Adriatic,
        while really all power was in the hands of the German rulers who
        posed as his vicegerents. He aimed at reconquering Italy, Africa, and
        Spain—if not the further provinces of the old empire. We shall see
        that he went far towards accomplishing his intention.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But during the
        first five years of his reign his attention was distracted by other
        matters. The first of them was an obstinate war of four years'
        duration, with Kobad, King of Persia. The causes of quarrel were
        ultimately the rival pretensions of the Roman and Persian Empires to
        the suzerainty of the small <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg
        074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        states on their northern frontiers near the Black Sea, the kingdoms
        of Lazica and Iberia, and more proximately the strengthening of the
        fortresses on the Mesopotamian border by Justinian. His fortification
        of Dara, close to the Persian frontier town of Nisibis, was the
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">casus belli</span></span> chosen by Kobad, who
        declared war in 528, a year after Justinian's accession.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Persian war
        was bloody, but absolutely indecisive. All the attacks of the enemy
        were repelled, and one great pitched battle won over him at Dara in
        530. But neither party succeeded in taking a single fortress of
        importance from the other; and when, on the death of Kobad, his son
        Chosroës made peace with the empire, the terms amounted to the
        restoration of the old frontier. The only importance of the war was
        that it enabled Justinian to test his army, and showed him that he
        possessed an officer of first-rate merit in Belisarius, the victor of
        the battle of Dara.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This famous
        general was a native of the Thracian inland; he entered the army very
        young, and rose rapidly, till at the age of twenty-three he was
        already Governor of Dara, and at twenty-five <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Magister militum</span></span> of the
        East.<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> His
        influence at Court was very great, as he had married Antonina, the
        favourite and confidante of the Empress Theodora. His position,
        indeed, was not unlike that which Marlborough, owing to his wife's
        ascendency, enjoyed at the Court of Queen Anne. Like Marlborough,
        too, Belisarius was ruled <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg
        075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        bullied by his clever and unscrupulous wife. Unlike the great Duchess
        Sarah, Antonina never set herself to thwart her mistress; but after
        Theodora's death she and her husband lost favour, and in declining
        years knew much the same misfortune as did the Marlboroughs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The year which saw
        the Persian War end [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 532], saw also the rise
        and fall of another danger, which while it lasted was much more
        threatening to the Emperor's life and power. We have already noticed
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“Blues”</span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Greens,”</span> the great factions of the Byzantine
        Circus.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> All
        through the fifth century they had been growing stronger, and
        interfered more and more in politics, and even in religious
        controversies. To be a <span class="tei tei-q">“Green”</span> in 530
        meant to be a partisan of the house of the late Emperor Anastasius,
        and a Monophysite.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href=
        "#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> The
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Blues”</span> posed as partisans of the
        house of Justinus, and as strictly orthodox in matters
        ecclesiastical. From mere Circus factions they had almost grown into
        political parties; but they still retained at the bottom many traces
        of their low sporting origin. The rougher elements pre-dominated in
        them; they were prone to riot and mischief, and, as the events of 532
        were to show, they were a serious danger to the State.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In January of that
        year there was serious rioting in the streets. Justinian, though
        ordinarily he favoured the Blue faction, impartially ordered the
        leaders of the rioters on both sides to be put to death. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Seven were selected for execution, and
        four of them were duly beheaded in the presence of a great and angry
        mob, in front of the monastery of St. Conon. The last three rioters
        were to be hung, but the hangman so bungled his task that two of the
        criminals, one a Blue the other a Green, fell to the ground alive.
        The guards seized them and they were again suspended; but once
        more—owing no doubt to the terror of the executioners at the menaces
        of the mob—the rope slipped. Then the multitude broke loose, the
        guards were swept away, and the half-hung criminals were thrust into
        sanctuary at the adjacent monastery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This exciting
        incident proved the commencement of six days of desperate rioting.
        The Blues and Greens united, and taking as their watchword,
        <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Nika</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“conquer,”</span> swept through the city, crying for the
        deposition of John of Cappadocia, the unpopular finance minister, and
        of Eudemius, Praefect of the city, who was immediately responsible
        for the executions. The ordinary police of the capital were quite
        unable to master them, and Justinian was weak enough to promise to
        dismiss the officials. But the mob was now quite out of hand, and
        refused to disperse: the trouble was fomented by the partisans of the
        house of the late emperor, who began to shout for the deposition of
        Justinian, and wished to make Hypatius, nephew of Anastasius, Cæsar
        in his stead. The city was almost empty of troops, owing to the
        garrison having been sent to the Persian War. The Emperor could only
        count on 4,000 men of the Imperial Guard, a few German auxiliaries,
        and a regiment <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg
        077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        500 <span class="tei tei-q">“Cataphracti,”</span> mailed horsemen,
        under Belisarius, who had just returned from the seat of war.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Belisarius was
        placed in command of the whole, and sallied out to clear the streets,
        but the rioters, showing the same pluck that the Byzantine mob
        displayed against the soldiers of Gainas a hundred and twenty-five
        years before, offered a stout resistance. The main fighting took
        place around the great square of the Augustaeum, between the Imperial
        palace and the Hippodrome. In the heat of the fight the rebels set
        fire to the Brazen Porch by the Senate House. The Senate House caught
        fire, and then the conflagration spread east and north, till it was
        wafted across the square to St. Sophia. On the third day of the riot
        the great cathedral was burnt to the ground, and from thence the
        flames issued out to burn the hospital of Sampson and the church of
        St. Irene.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href=
        "#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> The fire
        checked the fighting, and the insurgents were now in possession of
        most of the city. But they could not find their chosen leader, for
        the unfortunate Hypatius, who had no desire to risk his neck, had
        taken refuge with the Emperor in the palace. It was not till he was
        actually driven out by Justinian, who feared to have him about his
        person, that this rebel in spite of himself, fell into the hands of
        his own adherents. But on the sixth day of the riots they led him to
        the Hippodrome, installed him in the royal seat of the Kathisma, and
        crowned him there with a gold chain of his wife's, for want of a
        proper diadem.</p>

        councils in the Palace. John of Cappadocia and many other ministers
        strove to persuade the Emperor to fly by sea, and gather additional
        troops at Heraclea. There was nothing left in his power save the
        palace, and they insisted that if he remained there longer he would
        be surrounded by the rebels and cut off from escape. It was then that
        the Empress Theodora rose to the level of the occasion, refused to
        fly, and urged her husband to make one final assault on the enemy.

        but the soldiery forced both the side entrances, and after a hard
        struggle the rebels were entirely routed. Crowded into the enormous

        to deal, the power had passed within those six years into the hands
        of a weak and incapable sovereign. In Africa, Hilderic, the king of

        and avaricious as well as ungrateful, Theodahat possessed exactly
        those vices which were most suited to make him the scorn of his
        warlike subjects; he could count neither on their loyalty nor their
        respect in the event of a war.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both the Vandals
        in Africa and the Goths in Italy were at this time so weak as to
        invite an attack by an enterprising neighbour. They had, in fact,
        conquered larger realms than their limited numbers were really able
        to control. The original tribal hordes which had subdued Africa and
        Italy were composed of fifty or sixty thousand warriors, with their
        wives and children. Now such a body concentrated on one spot was
        powerful enough to bear down everything before it. But when the
        conquerors spread themselves abroad, they were but a sprinkling among
        the millions of provincials whom they had to govern. In all Italy
        there were probably but three cities—Ravenna, Verona, and Pavia—in
        which the Ostrogoths formed a large proportion of the population. A
        great army makes but a small nation, and the Goths and Vandals were
        too few to occupy such wide tracts as Italy and Africa. They formed
        merely a small aristocracy, governing by dint of the ascendency which
        their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name=
        "Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> fathers had won over
        the minds of the unwarlike populations which they had subdued. The
        only chance for the survival of the Ostrogothic and Vandal monarchies
        lay in the possibility of their amalgamating with the Roman
        provincial population, as the Franks, under more favourable
        circumstances, did with the conquered inhabitants of Gaul. This was
        seen by Theodoric, the great conqueror of Italy; and he did his best
        to reconcile Goth and Roman, held the balance with strict justice
        between the two, and employed Romans as well as Goths in the
        government of the country. But one generation does little to assuage
        old hatreds such as that between the conquerors and the conquered in
        Italy. Theodoric was succeeded by a child, and then by a ruffian, and
        his work ended with him. Even he was unable to strike at the most
        fatal difference of all between his countrymen and the Italians. The
        Goths were Arians, having been converted to Christianity in the
        fourth century by missionaries who held the Arian heresy. Their
        subjects, on the other hand, were Orthodox Catholics, almost without
        exception. When religious hatred was added to race hatred, there was
        hardly any hope of welding together the two nationalities.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another source of
        weakness in the kingdoms of Africa and Italy must be noted. The
        Vandals of the third generation and the Goths of the second, after
        their settlement in the south, seem to have degenerated in courage
        and stamina. It may be that the climate was unfavourable to races
        reared in the Danube lands; it may be that the temptations of
        unlimited luxury offered by Roman civilization sufficed to demoralize
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084"
        id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> them. A Gothic sage observed
        at the time that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Goth, when rich, tends
        to become Roman in his habits; the Roman, when poor, Gothic in
        his.”</span> There was truth in this saying, and the result of the
        change was ominous for the permanence of the kingdom of Italy. If the
        masters softened and the subjects hardened, they would not preserve
        for ever their respective positions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The case of the
        kingdom of Africa was infinitely worse than that of the kingdom of
        Italy. The Vandals were less numerous than the Goths, in proportion
        to their subjects; they were not merely heretics, but fanatical and
        persecuting heretics, which the Goths were not. Moreover, they had
        never had at their head a great organizer and administrator like
        Theodoric, but only a succession of turbulent princes of the Viking
        type, fit for war and nothing else.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justinian declared
        war on King Gelimer the moment that he had made peace with Persia,
        using as his <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">casus belli</span></span>, not
        a definite re-assertion of the claim of the empire over Africa—for
        such language would have provoked the rulers of Italy and Spain to
        join the Vandals, but the fact that Gelimer had wrongfully deposed
        Hilderic, the Emperor's ally. In July, 533, Belisarius, who was now
        at the height of his favour for his successful suppression of the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Nika”</span> rioters, sailed from the
        Bosphorus with an army of 10,000 foot and 5,000 horse. He was
        accompanied, luckily for history, by his secretary, Procopius, a very
        capable writer, who has left a full account of his master's
        campaigns. Belisarius landed at Tripoli, at the extreme eastern limit
        of the Vandal power. The town <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> was at once betrayed to him by its Roman
        inhabitants. From thence he advanced cautiously along the coast,
        meeting with no opposition; for the incapable Gelimer had been caught
        unprepared, and was still engaged in calling in his scattered
        warriors. It was not till he had approached within ten miles of
        Carthage that Belisarius was attacked by the Vandals. After a hard
        struggle he defeated them, and the city fell into his hands next
        clay. The provincials were delighted at the rout of their masters,
        and welcomed the imperial army with joy; there was neither riot nor
        pillage, and Carthage had not the aspect of a conquered town.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Calling up his
        last reserves, Gelimer made one more attempt to try the fortunes of
        war. He advanced on Carthage, and was met by Belisarius at
        Tricameron, on the road to Bulla. Again the day went against him; his
        army broke up, his last fortresses threw open their gates, and there
        was an end of the Vandal kingdom. It had existed just 104 years,
        since Genseric entered Africa in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
        429.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gelimer took
        refuge for a time with the Moorish tribes who dwelt in the fastnesses
        of Mount Atlas. But ere long he resolved to surrender himself to
        Belisarius, whose humanity was as well known as his courage. He sent
        to Carthage to say that he was about to give himself up, and—so the
        story goes—asked but for three things: a harp, to which to chant a
        dirge he had written on the fate of himself and the Vandal race; a
        sponge, to wipe away his tears; and a loaf, a delicacy he had not
        tasted ever since he had been forced to partake of the unsavoury
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086"
        id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> food of the Moors! Belisarius
        received Gelimer with kindness, and took him to Constantinople, along
        with the treasures of the palace of Carthage, which included many of
        the spoils of Rome captured by the Vandals eighty-six years before,
        when they sacked the imperial city, in 453. It is said that among
        these spoils were some of the golden vessels of the Temple at
        Jerusalem, which Titus had brought in triumph to Rome, and which
        Gaiseric had carried from Rome to Carthage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The triumphal
        entry of Belisarius into Constantinople with his captives and his
        spoils, encouraged Justinian to order instant preparations for an
        attack on the second German kingdom, on his western frontier. He
        declared war on the wretched King Theodahat in the summer of
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 435, using as his
        pretext the murder of Queen Amalasuntha, whom, as we have already
        said, her ungrateful spouse had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> first imprisoned and then strangled within a
        year of their marriage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king of the
        Goths, whether he was conscience-stricken or merely cowardly, showed
        the greatest terror at the declaration of war. He even wrote to
        Constantinople offering to resign his crown, if the Emperor would
        guarantee his life and his private property. Meanwhile he consulted
        soothsayers and magicians about his prospects, for he was as
        superstitious as he was incompetent. Procopius tells us a strange
        tale of the doings of a Jewish magician of note, to whom Theodahat
        applied. He took thirty pigs—to represent unclean Gentiles, we must
        suppose—and penned them in three styes, ten in each. The one part he
        called <span class="tei tei-q">“Goths,”</span> the second
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Italians,”</span> and the third <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Imperialists.”</span> He left the beasts without food or
        water for ten days, and bade the king visit them at the end of that
        time, and take augury from their condition. When Theodahat looked in
        he found all but two of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Goth”</span>
        pigs dead, and half of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Italians,”</span>
        but the <span class="tei tei-q">“Imperialists,”</span> though gaunt
        and wasted, were all, or almost all, alive. This portent the Jew
        expounded as meaning that at the end of the approaching war the
        Gothic race would be exterminated and their Italian subjects terribly
        thinned, while the Imperial troops would conquer, though with toil
        and difficult.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Theodahat
        was busying himself with portents, actual war had broken out on the
        Illyrian frontier between the Goths and the governor of Dalmatia.
        There was no use in making further offers to Justinian, and the king
        of Italy had to face the situation as best he could.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the summer of
        535, Belisarius landed in Sicily, with an even smaller army than had
        been given him to conquer Africa—only 3,000 Roman troops, all
        Isaurians, and 4,500 barbarian auxiliaries of different sorts.
        Belisarius' first campaign was as fortunate as had been that which he
        had waged against Gelimer. All the Sicilian towns threw open their
        gates except Palermo, where there was a considerable Gothic garrison,
        and Palermo fell after a short siege. In six months the whole island
        was in the hands of Belisarius.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Theodahat seemed
        incapable of defending himself; he fell into a condition of abject
        helplessness, which so provoked his warlike subjects, that when the
        news came that Belisarius had crossed over into Italy and taken
        Rhegium, they rose and slew him. In his stead the army of the Goths
        elected as their king Witiges, a middle-aged warrior, well known for
        personal courage and integrity, but quite incompetent to face the
        impending storm.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the fall of
        Rhegium, Belisarius marched rapidly on Naples, meeting no opposition;
        for the Goths were very thinly scattered through Southern Italy, and
        had not even enough men to garrison the Lucanian and Calabrian
        fortresses. Naples was taken by surprise, the Imperialists finding
        their way within the walls by crawling up a disused aqueduct. After
        this important conquest, Belisarius made for Rome, though his forces
        were reduced to a mere handful by the necessity of leaving garrisons
        in his late conquests. King Witiges made no effort to obstruct his
        approach. He had received news that the Franks <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> were threatening an evasion of Northern
        Italy, and went north to oppose an imaginary danger in the Alps, when
        he should have been defending the line of the Tiber. Having staved
        off the danger of a Frankish war by ceding Provence to King
        Theuderic, Witiges turned back, only to learn that Rome was now in
        the hands of the enemy. The troops of Leudaris, the Gothic general,
        who had been left with 4,000 men to defend the city, had been struck
        with panic at the approach of Belisarius, and were cowardly and
        idiotic enough to evacuate it without striking a blow. Five thousand
        men had sufficed to seize the ancient capital of the world!
        [December, 536.]</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next spring King
        Witiges came down with the main army of the Goths—more than 100,000
        strong—and laid siege to Rome. The defence of the town by Belisarius
        and his very inadequate garrison forms the most interesting episode
        in the Italian war. For more than a year the Ostrogoths lay before
        its walls, essaying every device to force an entry. They tried open
        storm; they endeavoured to bribe traitors within the city; they
        strove to creep along the bed of a disused aqueduct, as Belisarius
        had done a year before at Naples. All was in vain, though the
        besiegers outnumbered the garrison twenty-fold, and exposed their
        lives with the same recklessness that their ancestors had shown in
        the invasion of the empire a hundred years back. The scene best
        remembered in the siege was the simultaneous assault on five points
        in the wall, on the 21st of March, 537. Three of the attacks were
        beaten back with ease; but near the Prænestine Gate, at the
        south-east of the city, one <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg
        090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        storming party actually forced its way within the walls, and had to
        be beaten out by sheer hard fighting; and at the mausoleum of
        Hadrian, on the north-west, another spirited combat took place.
        Hadrian's tomb—a great quadrangular structure of white marble, 300
        feet square and 85 feet high—was surmounted by one of the most
        magnificent collections of statuary in ancient Rome, including four
        great equestrian statues of emperors at its corners. The Goths, with
        their ladders, swarmed at the foot of the tomb in such numbers, that
        the arrows and darts of the defenders were insufficient to beat them
        back. Then, as a last resource, the Imperialists tore down the scores
        of statues which adorned the mausoleum, and crushed the mass of
        assailants beneath a rain of marble fragments. Two famous antiques,
        that form the pride of modern galleries—the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Dancing Faun”</span> at Florence, and the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Barberini Faun”</span> at Munich—were found, a thousand
        years later, buried in the ditch of the tomb of Hadrian, and must
        have been among the missiles employed against the Goths. The rough
        usage which they then received proved the means of preserving them
        for the admiration of the modern world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A year and nine
        days after he had formed the siege of Rome, the unlucky Witiges had
        to abandon it. His army, reduced by sword and famine, had given up
        all hope of success, and news had just arrived that the Imperialists
        had launched a new army against Ravenna, the Gothic capital.
        Belisarius, indeed, had just received a reinforcement of 6,000 or
        7,000 men, and had wisely sent a considerable force, under an officer
        named John, to fall on the Adriatic coast.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The scene of the
        war was now transported further to the north; but its character still
        remained the same. The Romans gained territory, the Goths lost it.
        Firmly fixed at Ancona and Rimini and Osimo, Belisarius gradually
        forced his way nearer to Ravenna, and, in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 540 laid siege to it.
        Witiges, blockaded by Belisarius in his capital, made no such skilful
        defence as did his rival at Rome three years before. To add to his
        troubles, the Franks came down into Northern Italy, and threatened to
        conquer the valley of the Po, the last Gothic stronghold. Witiges
        then made proposals for submission; but Belisarius refused to grant
        any terms other than unconditional surrender, though his master
        Justinian was ready to acknowledge Witiges as vassal-king in
        Trans-Padane Italy. Famine drove Ravenna to open its gates, and the
        Goths, enraged at their imbecile king, and struck with admiration for
        the courage and generosity of Belisarius, offered to make their
        conqueror Emperor of the West. The loyal general refused; but bade
        the Goths disperse each to his home, and dwell peaceably for the
        future as subjects of the empire. [May, 540 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>] He himself, taking the
        great Gothic treasure-hoard from the palace of Theodoric, and the
        captive Witiges, sailed for Constantinople, and laid his trophies at
        his master's feet.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Italy now seemed
        even as Africa; only Pavia and Verona were still held by Gothic
        garrisons, and when he sailed home, Belisarius deemed his work so
        nearly done, that his lieutenants would suffice to crush out the last
        embers of the strife. He himself was required in the East, for a new
        Persian war with Chosroësroës, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> son of Kobad, was on the eve of breaking out.
        But things were not destined to end so. At the last moment the Goths
        found a king and a hero to rescue them, and the conquest of Italy was
        destined to be deferred for twelve years more. Two ephemeral rulers
        reigned for a few months at Pavia, and came to bloody ends; but their
        successor was Baduila,<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href=
        "#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> the
        noblest character of the sixth century—<span class="tei tei-q">“the
        first knight of the Middle Ages,”</span> as he has been called. When
        the generals of Justinian marched against him, to finish the war by
        the capture of Verona and Pavia, he won over them the first victory
        that the Goths had obtained since their enemies landed in Italy. This
        was followed by two more successes; the scattered armies of Witiges
        rallied round the banner of the new king, and at once the cities of
        Central and Southern Italy began to fall back into Gothic hands, with
        the same rapidity with which they had yielded to Belisarius. The fact
        was, that the war had been a cruel strain on the Italians, and that
        the imperial governors, and still more their fiscal agents, or
        <span class="tei tei-q">“logothetes,”</span> had become unbearably
        oppressive. Italy had lived through the fit of enthusiasm with which
        it had received the armies of Justinian, and was now regretting the
        days of Theodoric as a long-lost golden age. Most of its cities were
        soon in Baduila's hands; the Imperialists retained only the districts
        round Rome, Naples, Otranto, and Ravenna. Of Naples they were soon
        deprived. [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 543.] Baduila invested
        it, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name=
        "Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ere long constrained
        it to surrender. He treated the inhabitants with a kindness and
        consideration which no Roman general, except Belisarius, had ever
        displayed. A speech which he delivered to his generals soon after
        this success deserves a record, as showing the character of the man.
        A Gothic warrior had been convicted of violating the daughter of a
        Roman. Baduila condemned him to death. His officers came round him to
        plead for the soldier's life. He answered them that they must choose
        that day whether they preferred to save one man's life or the life of
        the Gothic race. At the beginning of the war, as they knew well, the
        Goths had brave soldiers, famous generals, countless treasure,
        horses, weapons, and all the forts of Italy. And yet under
        Theodahat—a man who loved gold better than justice—they had so
        angered God by their unrighteous lives, that all the troubles of the
        last ten years had come upon them. Now God seemed to have avenged
        Himself on them enough. He had begun a new course with them, and they
        must begin a new course with Him, and justice was the only path. As
        for the present criminal being a valiant hero, let them know that the
        unjust man and the ravisher was never brave in fight; but that,
        according to a man's life, such was his luck in battle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such was the
        justice of Baduila; and it seemed as if his dream was about to come
        true, and that the regenerate Goths would win back all that they had
        lost. Ere long he was at the gates of Rome, prepared to essay, with
        15,000 men, what Witiges had failed to do with 100,000. Lest all his
        Italian conquests should be lost, Justinian was obliged to send back
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094"
        id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Belisarius, for no one else
        could hold back the Goths. But Belisarius was ill-supplied with men;
        he had fallen into disfavour at Court, and the imperial ministers
        stinted him of troops and money. Unable to relieve Rome, he had to
        wait at Portus, by the mouth of the Tiber, watching for a chance to
        enter the city. That chance he never got. The famine-stricken Romans,
        angry with the cruel and avaricious Bessas, who commanded the
        garrison, began to long for the victory of their enemy; and one night
        some traitors opened the Asinarian Gate, and let in Baduila and his
        Goths. The King thought that his troubles were over; he assembled his
        chiefs, and bade them observe how, in the time of Witiges, 7,000
        Greeks had conquered, and robbed of kingdom and liberty, 100,000
        well-armed Goths. But now that they were few, poor, and wretched, the
        Goths had conquered more than 20,000 of the enemy. And why? Because
        of old they looked to anything rather than justice: they had sinned
        against each other and the Romans. Therefore they must choose
        henceforth, and be just men and have God with them, or unjust and
        have God against them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baduila had
        determined to do that which no general since Hannibal had
        contemplated: he would destroy Rome, and with it all the traditions
        of the world-empire of the ancient city—to him they seemed but
        snares, tending to corrupt the mind of the Goths. The people he sent
        away unharmed—they were but a few thousand left after the horrors of
        the famine during the siege. But he broke down the walls, and
        dismantled the palaces and arsenals. For a few weeks <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Rome was a deserted city, given up to the
        wolf and the owl [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 550].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For eleven unquiet
        years, Baduila, the brave and just, ruled Italy, holding his own
        against Belisarius, till the great general was called home by some
        wretched court intrigue. But presently Justinian gathered another
        army, more numerous than any that Belisarius had led, and sent it to
        Italy, under the command of the eunuch Narses. It was a strange
        choice that made the chamberlain into a general; but it succeeded.
        Narses marched round the head of the Adriatic, and invaded Italy from
        the north. Baduila went forth to meet him at Tagina, in the
        Apennines. For a long day the Ostrogothic knights rode again and
        again into the Imperialist ranks; but all their furious charges
        failed. At evening they reeled back broken, and their king received a
        mortal wound in the flight [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 553].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the death of
        Baduila, it was all up with the Goths; their hero's knightly courage
        and kingly righteousness had not sufficed to save them from the same
        doom which had overtaken the Vandals. The broken army made one last
        stand in Campania, under a chief named Teia; but he was slain in
        battle at Nuceria, and then the Goths surrendered. They told Narses
        that the hand of God was against them; they would quit Italy, and go
        back to dwell in the north, in the land of their fathers. So the poor
        remnant of the conquering Ostrogoths marched off, crossed the Po and
        the Alps, and passed away into oblivion in the northern darkness. The
        scheme of Justinian was complete. Italy was his; but an Italy
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096"
        id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> so wasted and depopulated,
        that the traces of the ancient Roman rule had almost vanished.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The land,”</span> says a contemporary
        chronicler, <span class="tei tei-q">“was reduced to primeval
        solitude”</span>—war and famine had swept it bare.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is strange to
        find that the Emperor was not tired out by waging this desperate war
        with the Goths; the moment it ended he began to essay another western
        conquest. There was civil war in Spain, and, taking advantage of it,
        Liberius, governor of Africa, landed in Andalusia, and rapidly took
        the great towns of the south of the peninsula—Cordova, <span class=

        factious Visigoths then dropped their strife, united in arms under
        King Athangild, and checked the further progress of the imperial
        arms. But a long slip of the lost territory was not recovered by
        them. Justinian and his successors, down to <span class=

        Reign.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The slackness with
        which the generals of Justinian prosecuted the Gothic war in the
        period between the triumph of Belisarius at Ravenna in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 540, and the final
        conquest of Italy in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 553, is mainly to be
        explained by the fact that, just at the moment of the fall of
        Ravenna, the empire became involved in a new struggle with its great
        Eastern neighbour. Chosroës of Persia was seriously alarmed at the
        African and Italian conquests of Justinian, and remembered that he
        too, as well as the Vandals and Goths, was in possession of provinces
        that had formerly been Roman, and might one day be reclaimed by the
        Emperor. He determined to strike before Justinian had got free from
        his Italian war, and while the flower of the Roman army was still in
        the West. Using as his pretext for war some petty quarrels between
        two tribes of Arabs, subject respectively to Persia and the empire,
        he declared war in the spring of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
        540. Justinian, as the king had hoped, was caught unprepared: the
        army of the Euphrates was so weak that it never dared face the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099"
        id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Persians in the field, and the
        opening of the war was fraught with such a disaster to the empire as
        had not been known since the battle of Adrianople, more than a
        hundred and sixty years before. Avoiding the fortresses of
        Mesopotamia, Chosroës, who led his army in person, burst into
        Northern Syria. His main object was to strike a blow at Antioch, the
        metropolis of the East, a rich city that had not seen an enemy for
        nearly three centuries, and was reckoned safe from all attacks owing
        to its distance from the frontier. Antioch had a strong garrison of
        6,000 men and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Blues”</span> and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Greens”</span> of its circus factions had
        taken arms to support the regular troops. But the commander was
        incompetent, and the fortifications had been somewhat neglected of
        late. After a sharp struggle, Chosroës took the town by assault; the
        garrison cut its way out, and many of the inhabitants escaped with
        it, but the city was sacked from cellar to garret and thousands of
        captives were dragged away by the Persians. Chosroës planted them by
        the Euphrates—as Nebuchadnezzar had done of old with the Jews—and
        built for them a city which he called Chosroantiocheia, blending his
        own name with that of their ancient abode.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This horrible
        disaster to the second city of the Roman East roused all Justinian's
        energy; neglecting the Italian war, he sent all his disposable troops
        to the Euphrates frontier, and named Belisarius himself as the chief
        commander. After this, Chosroës won no such successes as had
        distinguished his first campaign. Having commenced an attack on the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100"
        id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Roman border fortresses in
        Colchis, far to the north, he was drawn home by the news that
        Belisarius had invaded Assyria and was besieging Nisibis. On the
        approach of the king the imperial general retired, but his manœuvre
        had cost the Persian the fruits of a whole summer's preparation, and
        the year <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 541 ended without
        serious fighting. In the next spring very similar operations
        followed: Belisarius defended the line of the Euphrates with success,
        and the invaders retired after having reduced one single Mesopotamian
        fortress. The war lingered for two years more, till Chosroës,
        disgusted at the ill-success of all his efforts since his first
        success at Antioch, and more especially humiliated by a bloody
        repulse from the walls of Edessa, consented to treat for peace
        [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 545]. He gave up his
        conquests—which were of small importance—but regarded the honours of
        the war as being his own, because Justinian consented to pay him
        2,000 lbs. of gold [£108,000] on the ratification of the treaty. One
        curious clause was inserted in the document—though hostilities ceased
        everywhere else, the rights of the two monarchs to the suzerainty of
        the kingdom of Lazica, on the Colchian frontier, hard by the Black
        Sea, were left undefined. For no less than seven years a sort of
        by-war was maintained in this small district, while peace prevailed
        on all other points of the Perso-Roman frontier. It was not till
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 556, after both parties
        had wasted much treasure and many men on the unprofitable contest,
        that Chosroës resigned the attempt to hold the small and rugged
        mountain kingdom of the Lazi, and resigned it to <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Justinian on the promise of an annual
        grant of £18,000 as compensation money.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But although
        Justinian had brought his second Persian war to a not unsuccessful
        end, the empire had come badly out of the struggle, and was by 556
        falling into a condition of incipient disorder and decay. This was
        partly caused by the reckless financial expedients of the Emperor,
        who taxed the provinces with unexampled rigour while forced to
        maintain at once a Persian and an Italian war.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The main part of
        the damage, however, was wrought by other than human means. In
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 542 there broke out in
        the empire a plague such as had not been known for three hundred
        years—the last similar visitation had fallen in the reign of
        Trebonianus Gallus, far back in the third century. This pestilence
        was one of the epoch-making events in the history of the empire, as
        great a landmark as the Black Death in the history of England. The
        details which Procopius gives us concerning its progress and results
        leave no doubt that it operated more powerfully than any other factor
        in that weakening of the empire which is noticeable in the second
        half of the sixth century. When it reached Constantinople, 5,000
        persons a day are said to have fallen victims to it. All customary
        occupations ceased in the city, and the market-place was empty save
        for corpse-bearers. In many houses not a single soul remained alive,
        and the government had to take special measures for the burial of
        neglected corpses. <span class="tei tei-q">“The disease,”</span> says
        the chronicler, <span class="tei tei-q">“did not attack any
        particular race or class of men, nor prevail in any <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> particular region, nor confine itself to
        any period of the year. Summer or winter, North or South, Greek or
        Arabian, washed or unwashed—of such distinctions the plague took no
        account. A man might climb to the hill-top, and it was there; he
        might retire to the depths of a cavern, and it was there
        also.”</span> The only marked characteristic of its ravages that the
        chronicler could find was that, <span class="tei tei-q">“whether by
        chance or providential design, it strictly spared the most
        wicked.”</span><a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justinian himself
        fell ill of the plague: he recovered, but was never his old self
        again. Though he persevered inflexibly to his last day in his scheme
        for the reconquest of the empire, yet he seems to have declined in
        energy, and more especially to have lost that power of organization,
        which had been his most marked characteristic. The chroniclers
        complain that he had grown less hopeful and less masterful.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“After achieving so much in the days of his
        vigour, when he entered into the last stage of his life he seemed to
        weary of his labours, and preferred to create discord among his foes
        or to mollify them with gifts, instead of trusting to his arms and
        facing the dangers of war. So he allowed his troops to decline in
        numbers, because he did not expect to require their services. And his
        ministers, who collected his taxes and maintained his armies were
        affected with the same indifference.”</span><a id="noteref_13" name=
        "noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One feature of the
        Emperor's later years was that he took more and more interest in
        theological <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg
        103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        disputes, even to the neglect of State business. The Church question
        of the day was the dispute on Monophysitism, the heresy which denied
        the existence both of a human and a divine nature in Our Lord.
        Justinian was not a monophysite himself, but wished to unify the sect
        with the main body of the Church by edicts of comprehension, which
        forbade the discussion of the subject, and spent much trouble in
        coercing prelates orthodox and heretical into a reconciliation which
        had no chance of permanent success. His chief difficulty was with the
        bishops of Rome. He forced Pope Vigilius to come to Constantinople,
        and kept him under constraint for many months, till he signed all
        that was required of him [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 554]. The only result
        was to win Vigilius the reputation of a heretic, and to cause a
        growing estrangement between East and West.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gloom of
        Justinian's later years was even more marked after the death of his
        wife; Theodora died in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 548, six years after
        the great plague, and it may be that her loss was no less a cause of
        the diminished energy of his later years than was his enfeebled
        health. Her bold and adventurous spirit must have buoyed him up in
        many of the more difficult enterprises of the first half of his
        reign. After her death, Justinian seems to have trusted no one: his
        destined successor, Justinus, son of his sister, was kept in the
        background, and no great minister seems to have possessed his
        confidence. Even Belisarius, the first and most loyal soldier of the
        empire, does not appear to have been trusted: in the second Gothic
        war the Emperor stinted him of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> troops and hampered him with colleagues. At
        last he was recalled [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 549] and sent into
        private life, from which he was only recalled on the occurrence of a
        sudden military crisis in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 558.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This crisis was a
        striking example of the mismanagement of Justinian's later years. A
        nomad horde from the South Russian steppes, the Cotrigur Huns, had
        crossed the frozen Danube at mid-winter, when hostilities were least
        expected, and thrown themselves on the Thracian provinces. The empire
        had 150,000 men under arms at the moment, but they were all dispersed
        abroad, many in Italy, others in Africa, others in Spain, others in
        Colchis, some in the Thebaid, and a few on the Mesopotamian frontier.
        There was such a dearth of men to defend the home provinces that the
        barbarians rode unhindered over the whole country side from the
        Danube to the Propontis plundering and burning. One body, only 7,000
        strong, came up to within a few miles of the city gates, and inspired
        such fear that the Constantinopolitans began to send their money and
        church-plate over to Asia. Justinian then summoned Belisarius from
        his retirement, and placed him in command of what troops there were
        available—a single regiment of 300 veterans from Italy, and the

        troops 3,500 strong, raised in the city and entrusted with the charge
        of its gates, which inspired little confidence as its members were
        allowed to practice their trades and avocations and only called out
        in rotation for occasional service. With this undisciplined force,
        which had never seen war, at his back, Belisarius <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> contrived to beat off the Huns. He led
        them to pursue him back to a carefully prepared position, where the
        only point that could be attacked was covered with woods and hedges
        on either side. The untrustworthy <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Scholarians”</span> were placed on the flanks, where
        they could not be seriously molested, while the 300 Italian veterans
        covered the one vulnerable point. The Huns attacked, were shot down
        from the woods and beaten off in front, and fled leaving 400 men on
        the field, while the Romans only lost a few wounded and not a single
        soldier slain. Thus the last military exploit of Belisarius preserved
        the suburbs of the imperial city itself from molestation; after
        defending Old Rome in his prime, he saved New Rome in his old
        age.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even this last
        service did not prevent Justinian from viewing his great servant with
        suspicion. Four years later an obscure conspiracy against his life
        was discovered, and one of the conspirators named Belisarius as being
        privy to the plot. The old emperor affected to believe the
        accusation, sequestrated the general's property, and kept him under
        surveillance for eight months. Belisarius was then acquitted and
        restored to favour: he lived two years longer, and died in March,
        565.<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class=

        conqueror and governor we have <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> said much. But there remain two more aspects of
        his life which deserve notice—his work as a builder and his
        codification of the laws. From the days of Diocletian the style of
        architecture which we call Byzantine, for want of a better name, had
        been slowly developing from the old classic forms, and many of the
        emperors of the fourth and fifth centuries had been given to
        building. But no previous monarch had combined in such a degree as
        did Justinian the will and the power to launch out into architectural
        experiments. He had at his disposal the hoarded treasures of
        Anastasius, and his tastes were as magnificent as those of the great
        builders of the early empire, Augustus and Nero and Hadrian. All over
        the empire the monuments of his wealth and taste were seen in dozens
        of churches, halls of justice, monasteries, forts, hospitals, and
        colonnades. The historian Procopius was able to compose a
        considerable volume entirely on the subject of Justinian's buildings,
        and numbers of them survive, some perfect and more in ruins, to
        witness to the accuracy of the work. Even in the more secluded or
        outlying portions of the empire, any fine building that is found is,
        in two cases out of three, one of the works of Justinian. Not merely
        great centres like Constantinople or Jerusalem, but out-of-the-way
        tracts in Cappadocia and Isauria, are full of his buildings. Even in
        the newly-conquered Ravenna his great churches of San Vitale,
        containing the celebrated mosaic portraits of himself and his wife,
        and of St. Apollinare in the suburb of Classis, outshine the older
        works of the fifth-century emperors and of the Goth
        Theodoric.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justinian's
        churches, indeed, are the best known of his buildings. In Oriental
        church-architecture his reign forms a landmark: up to his time
        Christian architects had still been using two patterns copied
        straight from Old Roman models. The first was the round domed church,
        whose origin can be traced back to such Roman originals as the
        celebrated Temple of Vesta—of such the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
        at Rome may serve as a type. The second was the rectangular church
        with apses, which was nothing more than an adaptation for
        ecclesiastical purposes of the Old Roman law-courts, and which had
        borrowed from them its name of <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Basilica</span></span>. St. Paul's Outside the
        Walls, at Rome is a fair specimen. Justinian brought into use for the
        first time on a large scale the combination of a cruciform
        ground-plan and a very large dome. The famous Church of St. Sophia
        may serve as the type of this style. The great cathedral of
        Constantinople had already been burnt down twice, as we have had
        occasion to relate: the first time on the eve of the banishment of
        John Chrysostom, the second in the great <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nika”</span> riot of 532. Within forty days of its
        destruction Justinian had commenced preparations for rebuilding it as
        a monument of his triumph in the civil strife. He chose as his
        architect Anthemius of Tralles, the greatest of Byzantine builders,
        and one of the few whose names have survived. The third church was
        different in plan from either of its predecessors, showing the new
        combination which we have already specified. It is a Greek cross, 241
        feet long and 224 broad, having in its midst a vast dome, pierced by
        no <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name=
        "Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> less than forty
        windows, light and airy and soaring 180 feet above the floor. In the
        nave the aisles and side apses are parted from the main central
        spaces by magnificent colonnades of marble pillars, the majority of
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">verde
        antique</span></span>. These are not for the most part the work of
        Justinian's day, but were plundered from the chief pagan temples of
        Asia, which served as an inexhaustible quarry for the Christian
        builder. The whole of the interior, both roof and dome, was covered
        with gilding or mosaics, which the Vandalism of the Turks has covered
        with a coat of whitewash, to hide the representations of human forms
        which are offensive to the Moslems' creed. Procopius describes the
        church with enthusiasm, and his praises are well justified—</p>

        most glorious spectacle, extraordinary to those who behold it, and
        altogether incredible to those who know it by report only. In height
        it rises to the very heavens, and overtops the neighbouring buildings
        like a ship anchored among them. It towers above the city which it
        adorns, and from it the whole of Constantinople can be beheld, as
        from a watch-tower. Its breadth and length are so judiciously chosen,
        that it appears both broad and long without disproportion. For it
        excels both in size and harmony, being more magnificent than ordinary
        buildings, and much more elegant than the few which approach it in
        size. Within it is singularly full of light and sunshine; you would
        declare that the place is not lighted from without, but that the rays
        are produced within itself, such an abundance of light is</span>

          its interior, though the light reflected upon the gold from the
          marble surpasses it in beauty. Who can tell of the splendour of the
          columns and marbles with which the church is adorned? One would
          think that one had come upon a meadow full of flowers in bloom—one
          wonders at the purple tints of some, the green of others, the
          glowing red and glittering white, and those, too, which nature,
          like a painter, has marked with the strongest contrasts of colour.
          Moreover, it is impossible accurately to describe the treasures of
          gold and silver plate and gems which the Emperor has presented to
          the church: the Sanctuary alone contains forty thousand pounds
          weight of silver.</span><span style=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justinian was
        almost as great a builder of forts as of churches, but his military
        works have for the most part disappeared. It may give some idea of
        his energy in fortifying the frontiers when we state that the
        Illyrian provinces alone were protected by 294 forts, of which
        Procopius gives a list, disposed in four successive lines from the
        Danube back to the Thessalian hills. Some were single towers, but
        many were elaborate fortresses with outworks, and all had to be
        protected by garrisons.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus much of
        Justinian as builder: space fails to enumerate a tithe of his works.
        Of his great legal achievement we must speak at even shorter length.
        The Roman law, as he received it from his predecessors was an
        enormous mass of precedents and decisions, in which the original
        basis was overlaid with the various and sometimes contradictory
        rescripts <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg
        112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        five centuries of emperors. Several of his predecessors, and most
        especially Theodosius II., had endeavoured to codify the chaotic mass
        and reduce it to order. But no one of them had produced a code which
        sufficed to bring the law of the day into full accord with the spirit
        of the times. It was no mean work to bring the ancient legislation of
        Rome, from the days of the Twelve Tables down to the days of
        Justinian, into strict and logical connection with the new Christian
        ideas which had worked their way into predominance since the days of
        Constantine. Much of the old law was hopelessly obsolete, owing to
        the change in moral ideas which Christianity had introduced, but it
        is still astonishing to see how much of the old forms of the times of
        the early empire survived into the sixth century. Justinian employed
        a commission, headed by the clever but unpopular lawyer Tribonian, to
        draw up his new code. The work was done for ever and a day, and his
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Institutes”</span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pandects”</span> were the last revision of the Old Roman
        laws, and the starting-point of all systematic legal study in Europe,
        when, six hundred years later, the need for something more than
        customary folk-right began to make itself felt, as mediæval
        civilization evolved itself out of the chaos of the dark ages. If the
        Roman Empire had flourished in the century after Justinian as in that
        which preceded him, other revisers of the laws might have produced
        compilations that would have made the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Institutes”</span> seem out of date. But, as a matter of
        fact, decay and chaos followed after Justinian, and succeeding
        emperors had neither the need nor the inclination <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to do his work over again. Hence it came
        to pass that his name is for ever associated with the last great
        revision of Roman law, and that he himself went down to posterity as
        the greatest of legislators, destined to be enthroned by Dante in one
        of the starry thrones of his <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Paradise,”</span> and to be worshipped as the father of
        law by all the legists of the Renaissance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thirty years
        which followed the death of Justinian are covered by three reigns,
        those of Justinus II. [565-578], Tiberius Constantinus [578-582], and
        Maurice [582-602]. These three emperors were men of much the same
        character as the predecessors of Justinian; each of them was an
        experienced official of mature age, who was selected by the reigning
        emperor as his most worthy successor. Justinus was the favourite
        nephew of Justinian, and had served him for many years as
        Curopalates, or Master of the Palace. Tiberius Constantinus was
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Count of the Excubiti,”</span> a high Court
        officer in the suite of Justinus: Maurice again served Tiberius as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Count of the Fœderati,”</span> or chief of
        the Barbarian auxiliaries. They were all men of capacity, and strove
        to do their best for the empire: historians concur in praising the
        justice of Justinus, the liberality and humanity of Tiberius, the
        piety of Maurice. Yet under them the empire was steadily going down
        hill: the exhausting effects of the reign of Justinian were making
        themselves felt more and more, and at the end of the reign
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115"
        id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Maurice a time of chaos and
        disaster was impending, which came to a head under his successor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The internal
        causes of the disaster of this time were the weakening of the empire
        by the great plague of 544 and still more by the grinding exactions
        of Justinian's financial system. Its external phenomena were
        invasions by new hordes from the north, combined with long and
        exhausting wars with Persia. The virtues of the emperors seem to have
        helped them little: Justin's justice made him feared rather than
        loved; Tiberius's liberality rendered him popular, but drained the
        treasury; Maurice, on the other hand, who was economical and
        endeavoured to fill the coffers which his predecessors had emptied,
        was therefore universally condemned as avaricious.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The troubles on
        the frontier which vexed the last thirty years of the sixth century
        were due to three separate sets of enemies—the Lombards in Italy, the
        Slavs and Avars in the Balkan Peninsula, and the Persians in the
        East.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The empire held
        undisputed possession of Italy for no more than fifteen years after
        the expulsion of the Ostrogoths in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 553. Then a new enemy
        came in from the north, following the same path that had already
        served for the Visigoths of Alaric and the Ostrogoths of Theodoric.
        The new-comers were the race of the Lombards, who had hitherto dwelt
        in Hungary, on the Middle Danube, and had more frequently been found
        as friends than as foes of the Romans. But their warlike and
        ambitious King Alboin, having subdued all his nearer neighbours,
        began to covet the fertile plains of Italy, where <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> he saw the emperors keeping a very
        inadequate garrison, now that the Ostrogoths were finally driven
        away. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 568 Alboin and his
        hordes crossed the Alps, bringing with them wife and child, and
        flocks and herds, while their old land on the Danube was abandoned to
        the Avars. The Lombards took possession of the flat country in the
        north of Italy, as far as the line of the Po, with very little
        difficulty. The region, we are told, was almost uninhabited owing to
        the combined effects of the great plague and the Ostrogothic war. In
        this once fertile and populous, but now deserted, lowland, the
        Lombards settled down in great numbers. There they have left their
        name as the permanent denomination of the plain of Lombardy. Only one
        city, the strong fortress of Pavia, held out against them for long;
        when it fell in 571, after a gallant defence of three years, Alboin
        made it his capital, instead of choosing one of the larger and more
        famous towns of Milan and Verona, the older centres of life in the
        land he had conquered. After subduing Lombardy the king pushed
        forward into Etruria, and overran the valley of the Arno. But in the
        midst of his wars he was cut off, if the legend tells us the truth,
        by the vengeance of his wife Queen Rosamund. She was the daughter of
        Cunimund, King of the Gepidæ, whom Alboin had slain in battle. The
        fallen monarch's skull was, by the victor's orders, mounted in gold
        and fashioned into a cup. Long years after, amid the revelry of a
        drinking bout, Alboin had the ghastly cup filled with wine, and bade
        his wife bear it around to his chosen warriors. The queen obeyed, but
        vowed to revenge <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg
        117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        herself by her husband's death. By the sacrifice of her honour she
        bribed Alboin's armour-bearer to slay his master in his bed, and then
        fled with him to Constantinople [<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
        573].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the death of
        Alboin did not put an end to the Lombard conquests in Italy. The
        kingdom, indeed, broke up for a time into several independent
        duchies, but the Lombard chiefs continued to win territory from the
        empire. Two of them founded the considerable duchies of Spoleto and
        Benevento, the one in Central, and the other in Southern Italy. These
        states survived as independent powers, but the rest of the Lombard
        territories were reunited by King Autharis, in 584, and he and his
        immediate successors completed the conquest of Northern Italy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, during the
        reigns of Justin, Tiberius II., and Maurice, the greater part of
        Justinian's Italian conquests were lost, and formed once more into
        Teutonic states. The emperor retained only two large stretches of
        territory, the one in Central Italy, where he held a broad belt of
        land, extending right across the peninsula, from Ravenna and Ancona
        on the Adriatic, to Rome on the Tyrrhenian Sea; the other
        comprehending the extreme south of the land—the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“toe”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“heel”</span> of
        the Italian boot—and comprising the territory of Bruttium and the
        Calabrian<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href=
        "#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> towns of
        Taranto, Brindisi, and Otranto. Sardinia and Sicily were also left
        untouched by the Lombards, who never succeeded in building a fleet.
        The Roman territory which stretched across Central Italy cut the
        Lombards <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg

        two, the king ruling the main body of them in Tuscany and the valley
        of the Po; while the dukes of Spoleto and Benevento maintained an
        isolated existence in the south.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This partition of
        Italy between the Lombards and the empire is worth remembering, from
        the fact that never again, till our own day, was the whole peninsula
        gathered into a single state. Not till 1870, when the kingdom of
        United Italy was completed by the conquest of Rome, did a time come
        when all the lands between the Alps and the Straits of Messina were
        governed by one ruler. Justinian had no successor till Victor
        Emmanuel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the Lombard
        conquest the imperial dominions in Italy were administered by a
        governor, called the Exarch, who dwelt at Ravenna, the northernmost
        and strongest of the imperial fortresses. All the Italian provinces
        were nominally beneath his control, but, as a matter of fact, he was
        only treated with implicit obedience by those of his subordinates who
        dwelt in his own neighbourhood. He found it harder to enforce his
        orders at Naples and Reggio, or in the distant islands of Sicily and
        Sardinia. But it was the bishops of Rome who profited most by his
        absence: although a <span class="tei tei-q">“duke,”</span> a military
        officer of some importance, dwelt at Rome, he was from the first
        overshadowed by his spiritual neighbour. Even during the days of the
        Ostrogoths the Roman bishops had acquired considerable importance, as
        being the chief official representatives of the Italians in dealings
        with their Teutonic masters. But they spoke with much more freedom
        and weight when they had to do, not with a King of Italy dwelling
        quite near them, but with a mere governor fettered by orders from
        distant Constantinople. Gregory the Great [590-604] was the first of
        the popes who began to assume an independent attitude <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and to treat the Exarch at Ravenna with
        scant ceremony. He was an able and energetic man, who could not bear
        to see Rome suffering for want of a ruler on the spot, and readily
        took upon himself civil functions, in spite of the protests of his
        nominal superior the Exarch. In 592, for example, he made a private
        truce for Rome with the Lombard Duke of Spoleto, though the latter
        was at war with the empire. The Emperor Maurice stormed at him as
        foolish and disobedient, but did not venture to depose him, being too
        much troubled with Persian and Avaric wars to send troops against
        Rome. On another occasion Gregory nominated a governor for Naples,
        instead of leaving the appointment to the Exarch. In 599 he acted as
        mediator between the Lombard king and the government at Ravenna, as
        if he had been a neutral and independent sovereign. Although he
        showed no wish to sever his connection with the Roman Empire, Gregory
        behaved as if he considered the emperor his suzerain rather than his
        immediate ruler. He would never give in on disputed points, issued
        orders which contradicted imperial rescripts, and maintained a bitter
        quarrel with successive patriarchs of Constantinople, who possessed
        the favour of Maurice. When the patriarch John the Faster took the
        title of <span class="tei tei-q">“œcumenical bishop,”</span> Gregory
        wrote to Maurice to tell him that the presumption of John was a sure
        sign that the days of Antichrist were at hand, and to urge him to
        repress such pretensions by the force of the civil arm. This is one
        of the first signs of the approach of that mediæval view of the
        papacy which imagined that it was the pontiff's duty to censure and
        advise kings <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg
        121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        emperors on all possible topics and occasions. Gregory's immediate
        successors were not men of mark, or a breach with the empire might
        have been precipitated. The final disavowal of the supremacy of the
        Constantinopolitan monarch was to be still delayed for nearly two
        hundred years.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wars between
        the Exarchs of Ravenna and the Lombard kings were little influenced
        by interference from the East. The emperors during the last thirty
        years of the sixth century were far more engrossed with their Persian
        and Slavonic wars. Contests with the Great king of the East occupied
        no less than twenty years in the reigns of Justin II., Tiberius, and
        Maurice. War was declared in 572, and did not cease till 592. Like
        the struggle between Justinian and Chosroës I., thirty years before,
        it was wholly indecisive. There were more plundering raids than
        battles, and the frontier provinces of each empire were reduced to a
        dreadful state of desolation and depopulation: if the Persians pushed
        their ravages as far as the gates of Antioch, Roman generals
        penetrated deep into Media and Corduene, where the imperial banner
        had not been seen for two hundred years. The net result of the whole
        twenty years of strife was that each combatant had seriously weakened
        and distressed his rival, without obtaining any definite superiority
        over him. Forced to make peace by the pressure of a civil war,
        Chosroës II. gave back to Maurice the two frontier cities of Dara and
        Martyropolis, the sole trophies of twenty campaigns, and ceded him a
        slice of Armenian territory. But these trivial gains were far from
        compensating the empire <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg
        122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> for
        the fearful losses caused by dozens of Persian invasions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Persian war
        was exhausting, but successful: on the northern frontier, however,
        the Roman army had been faring far worse, and serious losses of
        territory were beginning to take place. The enemies in this quarter
        were two new tribes, who appeared on the Danube after the Lombards
        had departed from it to commence their invasion of Italy. There were
        now no Teutons left on the northern frontier of the empire: of the
        incoming tribes, one was Tartar and the other Slavonic. The Avars
        were a nomadic race from Asia, wild horsemen of the Steppes, much
        like their predecessors the Huns. They had fled west to escape the
        Turks, who were at this time building up an empire in Central Asia,
        and betook themselves to the South Russian plains, not far from the
        mouth of the Danube. To cross the river and ravage Moesia was too
        tempting a prospect to be neglected, and ere long the Avaric cavalry
        were seen only too frequently along the Balkans and on the coast of
        the Black Sea. Their first raid into Roman territory fell into the
        year 562, just before the death of Justinian, and from that time
        forward they were always causing trouble. They were ready enough to
        make peace when money was paid them, but as they invariably broke the
        agreement when the money was spent, it was never long before they
        reappeared south of the Danube.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the Slavs were
        a far more serious danger to the empire than the Avars. The latter
        came only to plunder, the former—like the Germans two centuries
        before—came pressing into the provinces to win themselves
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123"
        id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a new home. The Romans knew at
        first of only two tribes of them, the Slovenes and Antae, but behind
        these there were others who were gradually to push their way to the
        south and make their presence known—Croats, Servians, and many more.
        The Slavs were the easternmost of the Aryan peoples of Europe, and by
        far the most backward. They had always lain behind the Germans, and
        it was only when the German barrier was removed by the migration of
        the Goths and Lombards that they came into touch with the empire.
        They were rude races, far behind the Teutons in civilization; they
        had hardly learnt as yet the simplest arts, knew nothing of defensive
        armour, and could only use for boats tree-trunks hollowed out by
        fire—like the Australian savages of to-day. They had not learnt to
        live under kings or chiefs, but dwelt in village communities,
        governed by the patriarchs of the several families. Their abodes were
        mud huts, and they cultivated no grain but millet. When they went to
        war they could send out thousands of spearmen and bowmen, but their
        wild bands were not very formidable in the open field. They could
        resist neither cavalry nor disciplined infantry, and were only
        formidable in woods and defiles, where they formed ambuscades and
        endeavoured to take their enemy by surprise, and overwhelm him by a
        sudden rush. We are assured that one of their favourite devices was
        to conceal themselves in ponds or rivers by lying down in the water
        for hours together, breathing through reeds, whose points were the
        only things visible above the surface. Thus a thousand men might be
        concealed, and nothing appear except <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> a bed of rushes. This strange stratagem would
        seem incredible, if we had not on record one or two occasions on
        which it was actually practised.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Slavs had
        begun to make themselves felt early in the sixth century, but it was
        not till the death of Justinian that we hear of them as a pressing
        danger. But when the Lombards had passed away westward, they came
        down to the Danube and began to cross it in great numbers, in the
        endeavour to make permanent settlements on the Roman bank. The raids
        of the Slavs and the Avars were curiously complicated, for the king,
        or Chagan, of the Tartar tribe had made vassals of many of his
        Slavonic neighbours. They, on the other hand, sometimes acted in
        obedience to him, but more frequently tried to escape from his power
        by pushing forward into Roman territory. Hence it comes that we often
        find Slav and Avar leagued together, but at other times find them
        acting separately, or even in opposition to each other. A more
        chaotic series of campaigns it is hard to conceive.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Down to this time
        the inland of the Balkan peninsula had been inhabited by Thracian and
        Illyrian provincials, of whom the majority spoke the Latin tongue,
        though a few still preserved their ancient barbaric idiom.<a id=
        "noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> They
        formed the only large body of subjects of the empire outside Italy,
        who still spoke the old ruling language, and as they were about a
        quarter of its population, they did much to preserve its Roman
        character, and to prevent it from becoming <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Greek or Asiatic. Their pride in their Latin
        tongue was very marked: Justinian, born in the heart of the district,
        was fond of laying special stress on the fact that Latin was his
        native language.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On this Latinized
        Thraco-Illyrian population the invasion of the Slavs and Avars fell
        with unexampled severity. The Goths had afflicted them before, but
        they, at least, had been Christian and semi-civilized, while the
        new-comers were in the lowest grade of savagery. It is not too much
        to say that between 570 and 600 the old population was almost
        exterminated over the greater part of the country north of the
        Balkans—the modern Servia and Bulgaria—and very sadly cut down even
        in the more sheltered Macedonian and Thracian provinces. The
        Latin-speaking provincials almost disappeared: the only remnants of
        them were the Dalmatian islanders and the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Vlachs”</span> or Wallachians who are found in later
        times scattered in small bodies among the Slavs who had swept over
        the whole country-side. The effect of the invasion is well described
        by the contemporary chronicler, John of Ephesus—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The year 581 was famous for the invasion of the accursed
        people called Slavonians, who overran Greece and the country by
        Thessalonica, and all Thrace, and captured the cities and took many
        forts, and devastated and burnt, and reduced the people to slavery,
        and made themselves masters of the whole country, and settled in it,
        by main force, and dwelt in it as though it had been their own. Four
        years have now elapsed, and still they live at their ease in the
        land, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name=
        "Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and spread themselves
        far and wide, as far as God permits them, and ravage and burn and
        take captive, and still they encamp and dwell there.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The open country
        was swept bare by the Slavs: the towns resisted better, for neither
        Slav nor Avar was skilled in siege operations. Relying upon the
        fortified towns as his base the great general Priscus, whom Maurice
        placed in command, was able to keep his ground along the Danube, and
        to perform many gallant exploits. He even crossed the river and
        attacked the Slavs and Avars in their own homes beyond it; but it was
        to no effect that he burnt their villages and slew off their
        warriors. He could not protect the unarmed population in the open
        country within the Roman boundary, and the girdle of fortresses along
        the Danube soon covered nothing but a wasted region, sparsely
        inhabited by Slavs. The limit of Roman population had fallen back to
        the line of the Balkans, and even to the south of it, and the Slavs
        were ever slipping across the Danube in larger and larger numbers,
        despite the garrisons along the river which were still kept up from
        Singidunum [Belgrade] to Dorostolum [Silistria].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The misfortunes of
        the Avaric and Slavonic war were the cause of the fall of the Emperor
        Maurice. He had won some unpopularity by his manifest inability to
        stem the tide of the barbarian invasion, and more by an act of
        callousness, of which he was guilty in 599. The Chagan of the Avars
        had captured 15,000 prisoners, and offered to release them for a
        large ransom. Maurice—whose treasury was empty—refused to comply, and
        the Chagan massacred the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg
        127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        wretched captives. But the immediate cause of the emperor's fall was
        his way of dealing with the army. He was unpopular with the soldiery,
        though an old soldier himself, and did not possess their respect or
        confidence. Yet he was an officer of some merit and had written a
        long military treatise called the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Strategicon,”</span> which was the official handbook of
        the imperial armies for three hundred years.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Maurice sealed his
        fate when, in 602, he issued orders for the discontented army of the
        Danube to winter north of the river, in the waste marshes of the
        Slavs. The troops refused to obey the order, and chased away their
        generals. Then electing as their captain an obscure centurion, named
        Phocas, they marched on Constantinople.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Maurice armed the
        city factions, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Blues”</span> and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Greens,”</span> and strove to defend
        himself. But when he saw that no one would fight for him, he fled
        across the Bosphorus with his wife and children, to seek refuge in
        the Asiatic provinces, where he was less unpopular than in Europe.
        Soon he was pursued by orders of Phocas, whom the army had now
        saluted as emperor, and caught at Chalcedon. The cruel usurper had
        him executed along with all his five sons, the youngest a child of
        only three years of age. Maurice died with a courage and piety that
        moved even his enemies, exclaiming with his last breath, <span class=

        judgments!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the first time
        since Constantinople had become the seat of empire the throne had
        been won by armed rebellion and the murder of the legitimate ruler.
        The break in the peaceful and orderly succession which had hitherto
        prevailed was not only an evil precedent, but an immediate disaster.
        The new emperor proved a far worse governor than the unfortunate
        Maurice, who, in spite of his faults and his ill luck, had always
        been hard-working, moderate, pious, and economical. Phocas was a mere
        brutal soldier—cruel, ignorant, suspicious, and reckless, and in his
        incapable hands the empire began to fall to pieces with alarming
        rapidity. He opened his reign with a series of cruel executions of
        his predecessor's friends, and from that moment his deeds of
        bloodshed never ceased: probably the worst of them was the execution
        of Constantina, widow of Maurice and daughter of Tiberius II., whom
        he slew together with her three young daughters, lest their names
        might be used as the excuse for a conspiracy against him. But even
        greater horror seems to have been caused when <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> he burnt alive the able general

        "#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> who had
        won many laurels in the last Persian war. Narses had come up to the
        capital under safe conduct to clear himself from accusations of
        treason: so the Emperor not only devised a punishment which had never
        yet been heard of since the empire became Christian, but broke his
        own plighted oath.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The moment that
        Phocas had mounted the throne, Chosroës of Persia declared war on
        him, using the hypocritical pretext that he wished to revenge
        Maurice, for whom he professed a warm personal friendship. This war
        was far different from the indecisive contests in the reigns of
        Justinian and Justin II. In two successive years the Persians burst
        into North Syria and ravaged it as far as the sea; but in the third
        they turned north and swept over the hitherto untouched provinces of
        Asia Minor. In 608 their main army penetrated across Cappadocia and
        Galatia right up to the gates of Chalcedon. The inhabitants of
        Constantinople could see the blazing villages across the water on the
        Asiatic shore—a sight as new as it was terrifying; for although
        Thrace had several times been harried to within sight of the city, no
        enemy had ever been seen in Bithynia.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Plot after plot
        was formed in the capital against Phocas, but he succeeded in putting
        them all down, and slew the conspirators with fearful tortures. For
        eight years his reign continued: Constantinople was full of
        executions; Asia was ravaged from sea to sea; the Thracian and
        Illyrian provinces were overrun more and more by the Slavs, now that

        130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        Europe had been transferred across the Bosphorus to make head against
        the Persians. Yet Phocas still held on to Constantinople: the
        creature of a military revolt himself, it was by a military revolt
        alone that he was destined to be overthrown.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Africa was the
        only portion of the Roman Empire which in the reign of Phocas was
        suffering neither from civil strife nor foreign invasion. It was well
        governed by the aged exarch Heraclius, who was so well liked in the
        province that the emperor had not dared to depose him. Urged by
        desperate entreaties from all parties in Constantinople to strike a
        blow against the tyrant, and deliver the empire from the yoke of a
        monster, Heraclius at last consented. He quietly got ready a fleet,
        which he placed under the orders of his son, who bore the same name
        as himself. This he despatched against Constantinople, while at the
        same time his nephew Nicetas led a large body of horse along the
        African shore to invade Egypt.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Heraclius the
        younger arrived with his fleet at the Dardanelles, all the prominent
        citizens of Constantinople fled secretly to take refuge with him. As
        he neared the capital the troops of Phocas burst into mutiny: the
        tyrant's fleet was scattered after a slight engagement, and the city
        threw open its gates. Phocas was seized in the palace by an official
        whom he had cruelly wronged, and brought aboard the galley of the
        conqueror. <span class="tei tei-q">“Is it thus,”</span> said
        Heraclius, <span class="tei tei-q">“that you have governed the
        empire?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Will you govern it any
        better?”</span> sneered the desperate usurper. Heraclius spurned him
        away with his foot, and the sailors hewed him to pieces on the
        deck.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg
        131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next day the
        patriarch and the senate hailed Heraclius as emperor, and he was duly
        crowned in St. Sophia on October 5, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 610.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Heraclius took
        over the empire in such a state of disorder and confusion that he
        must soon have felt that there was some truth in the dying sneer of
        Phocas. It seemed almost impossible to get things into better order,
        for resources were wanting. Save Africa and Egypt and the district
        immediately around the capital, all the provinces were overrun by the
        Persian, the Avar, and the Slav. The treasury was empty, and the army
        had almost disappeared owing to repeated and bloody defeats in Asia
        Minor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Heraclius seems at
        first to have almost despaired of the possibility of evolving order
        out of this chaos, though he was in the prime of life and
        strength—<span class="tei tei-q">“a man of middle stature, strongly
        built, and broad-chested, with grey eyes and yellow hair, and of a
        very fair complexion; he wore a bushy beard when he came to the
        throne, but afterwards cut it short.”</span> For the first twelve
        years of his reign he remained at Constantinople, endeavouring to
        reorganize the empire, and to defend at any rate the frontiers of
        Thrace and Asia Minor. The more distant provinces he hardly seems to
        have hoped to save, and the chronicle of his early years is filled
        with the catalogue of the losses of the empire. Mesopotamia and North
        Syria had already been lost by Phocas, but in 613, while the imperial
        armies were endeavouring to defend Cappadocia, the Persian general
        Shahrbarz turned southwards and attacked Central Syria. The great
        town of Damascus fell into his hands; but worse <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was to come. In 614 the Persian army
        appeared before the holy city of Jerusalem, took it after a short
        resistance, and occupied it with a garrison. But the populace rose
        and slaughtered the Persian troops when Shahrbarz had departed with
        his main army. This brought him back in wrath: he stormed the city
        and put 90,000 Christians to the sword, only sparing the Jewish
        inhabitants. Zacharias, Patriarch of Jerusalem, was carried into
        captivity, and with him went what all Christians then regarded as the
        most precious thing in the world—the wood of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“True Cross.”</span> Helena, the mother of Constantine,
        had dug the relic up, according to the well-known legend, on Mount
        Moriah, and built for it a splendid shrine. Now Shahrbarz desecrated
        the church and took off the <span class="tei tei-q">“True
        Cross”</span> to Persia.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This loss brought
        the inhabitants of the East almost to despair; they thought that the
        luck of the empire had departed with the Holy Wood, which had served
        as its Palladium, and even imagined that the Last Day was at hand and
        that Chosroës of Persia was Antichrist. The mad language of pride and
        insult which the Persian in the day of his triumph used to Heraclius
        might also explain their belief. His blasphemous phrases seem like an
        echo of the letter of Sennacherib in the Second Book of Kings. The
        epistle ran:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Chosroës, greatest of gods, and master of the whole
        earth, to Heraclius, his vile and insensate slave. Have I not
        destroyed the Greeks? You say you trust in your God: why, then, has
        he not delivered out of my hand Caesarea, Jerusalem, and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Alexandria? Shall I not also destroy
        Constantinople? But I will pardon all your sins if you will come to
        me with your wife and children; I will give you lands, vines, and
        olive groves, and will look upon you with a kindly aspect. Do not
        deceive yourself with the vain hope in that Christ, who was not even
        able to save himself from the Jews, who slew him by nailing him to a
        cross.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The horror and
        rage roused by the loss of the <span class="tei tei-q">“True
        Cross”</span> and the blasphemies of King Chosroës brought about the
        first real outburst of national feeling that we meet in the history
        of the Eastern Empire. It was felt that the fate of Christendom hung
        in the balance, and that all, from highest to lowest, were bound to
        make one great effort to beat back the fire-worshipping Persians from
        Palestine, and recover the Holy Places. The Emperor vowed that he
        would take the field at the head of the army—a thing most
        unprecedented, for since the death of Theodosius I., in 395, no
        Caesar had ever gone out in person to war. The Church came forward in
        the most noble way—at the instance of the Patriarch Sergius all the
        churches of Constantinople sent their treasures and ornaments to the
        mint to be coined down, and serve as a great loan to the state, which
        was to be repaid when the Persians should have been conquered. The
        free dole of corn which the inhabitants of the capital had been
        receiving ever since the days of Constantine was abolished, and the
        populace bore the privation without demur. It was indeed observed
        that this measure not only saved the treasury, but drove into the
        army—where <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg
        134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        they were useful—thousands of the able-bodied loiterers who were the
        strength of the circus factions and the pest of the city. If the dole
        had been continued Heraclius could not have found a penny for the
        war. Egypt, the granary of the empire, had been lost in 616, and the
        supply of government corn entirely cut off, so that the dole would
        have had to be provided by the treasury buying corn, a ruinously
        expensive task.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the aid of the
        Church loan Heraclius equipped a new army and strengthened his fleet.
        He also provided for the garrisoning of Constantinople by an adequate
        force, a most necessary precaution, for in 617 the Persians had again
        forced their way to the Bosphorus, and this time captured Chalcedon.
        Heraclius would probably have taken the field next year but for
        troubles with the Avars. That wild race had long been working their
        wicked will on the almost undefended Thracian provinces, but now they
        promised peace. Heraclius went out, at the Chagan's pressing
        invitation, to meet him near Heraclea. But the conference was a
        snare, for the treacherous savage had planted ambushes on the way to
        secure the person of the Emperor, and Heraclius only escaped by the
        speed of his horse. He cast off his imperial mantle to ride the
        faster, and galloped into the capital just in time to close its gates
        as the vanguard of the Chagan's army came in sight. The Avars kept
        the Emperor engaged for some time, and it was not till 622 that he
        was able to take the field against the Persians.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This expedition of
        Heraclius was in spirit the first <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the Crusades. It was the first war that the
        Roman Empire had ever undertaken in a spirit of religious enthusiasm,
        for it was to no mere political end that the Emperor and his people
        looked forward. The army marched out to save Christendom, to conquer
        the Holy Places, and to recover the <span class="tei tei-q">“True
        Cross.”</span> The men were wrought up to a high pitch of enthusiasm
        by warlike sermons, and the Emperor carried with him, to stimulate
        his zeal, a holy picture—one of those <span lang="el" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">eikons</span></span> in which the Greek Church
        has always delighted—which was believed to be the work of no mortal
        hands.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Heraclius made no
        less than six campaigns (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 622-27) in his gallant
        and successful attempt to save the half-ruined empire. He won great
        and well-deserved fame, and his name would be reckoned among the
        foremost of the world's warrior-kings if it had not been for the
        misfortunes which afterwards fell on him in his old age.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His first campaign
        cleared Asia Minor of the Persian hosts, not by a direct attack, but
        by skilful strategy. Instead of attacking the army at Chalcedon, he
        took ship and landed in Cilicia, in the rear of the enemy,
        threatening in this position both Syria and Cappadocia. As he
        expected, the Persians broke up from their camp opposite
        Constantinople, and came back to fall upon him. But after much
        manœuvring he completely beat the general Shahrbarz, and cleared Asia
        Minor of the enemy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In his next
        campaigns Heraclius endeavoured to liberate the rest of the Roman
        Empire by a similar plan: he resolved to assail Chosroës at home, and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136"
        id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> force him to recall the armies
        he kept in Syria and Egypt to defend his own Persian provinces. In
        623-4 the Emperor advanced across the Armenian mountains and threw
        himself into Media, where his army revenged the woes of Antioch and
        Jerusalem by burning the fire-temples of Ganzaca—the Median
        capital—and Thebarmes, the birthplace of the Persian prophet
        Zoroaster. Chosroës, as might have been expected, recalled his troops
        from the west, and fought two desperate battles to cover Ctesiphon.
        His generals were defeated in both, but the Roman army suffered
        severely. Winter was at hand, and Heraclius fell back on Armenia. In
        his next campaign he recovered Roman Mesopotamia, with its fortresses
        of Amida, Dara, and Martyropolis, and again defeated the general
        Shahrbarz.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But 626 was the
        decisive year of the war. The obstinate Chosroës determined on one
        final effort to crush Heraclius, by concerting a joint plan of
        operations with the Chagan of the Avars. While the main Persian army
        watched the emperor in Armenia, a great body under Shahrbarz slipped
        south of him into Asia Minor and marched on the Bosphorus. At the
        same moment the Chagan of the Avars, with the whole force of his
        tribe and of his Slavonic dependants, burst over the Balkans and
        beset Constantinople on the European side. The two barbarian hosts
        could see each other across the water, and even contrived to exchange
        messages, but the Roman fleet sailing incessantly up and down the
        strait kept them from joining forces.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the June, July,
        and August of 626 the capital <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> was thus beset: the danger appeared imminent,
        and the Emperor was far away on the Euphrates. But the garrison was
        strong, the patrician Bonus, its commander, was an able officer, the
        fleet was efficient, and the same crusading fervour which had
        inspired the Constantinopolitans in 622 still buoyed up their
        spirits. In the end of July 80,000 Avars and Slavs, with all sorts of
        siege implements, delivered simultaneous assaults along the land
        front of the city, but they were beaten back with great slaughter.
        Next the Chagan built himself rafts and tried to bring the Persians
        across, but the Roman galleys sunk the clumsy structures, and slew
        thousands of the Slavs who had come off in small boats to attack the
        fleet. Then the Chagan gave up the siege in disgust and retired
        across the Danube.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Heraclius had
        shown great confidence in the strength of Constantinople and the
        courage of its defenders. He sent a few veteran troops to aid the
        garrison, but did not slacken from his attack on Persia. While
        Shahrbarz and the Chagan were besieging his capital, he himself was
        wasting Media and Mesopotamia. He imitated King Chosroës in calling
        in Tartar allies from the north, and revenged the ravages of the
        Avars in Thrace by turning 40,000 Khazar horsemen loose on Northern
        Persia. The enemy gave way before him everywhere, and the Persians
        began to grow desperate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next year King
        Chosroës put into the field the last levy of Persia, under a general
        named Rhazates, whom he bid to go out and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“conquer or die.”</span> At the same time he wrote to
        command Shahrbarz to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg
        138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        evacuate Chalcedon and return home in haste. But Heraclius
        intercepted the despatch of recall, and Shahrbarz came not.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Near Nineveh
        Heraclius fell in with the Persian home army and inflicted on it a
        decisive defeat. He himself, charging at the head of his cavalry,
        rode down the general of the enemy and slew him with his lance.
        Chosroës could put no new army in the field, and by Christmas
        Heraclius had seized his palace of Dastagerd, and divided among his
        troops such a plunder as had never been seen since Alexander the
        Great captured Susa.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Nemesis of
        Chosroës' insane vanity had now arrived. Ten years after he had
        written his vaunting letter to Heraclius he found himself in far
        worse plight than his adversary had ever been. After Dastagerd had
        fallen he retired to Ctesiphon, the capital of his empire, but even
        from thence he had to flee on the approach of the enemy. Then the end
        came: his own son Siroes and his chief nobles seized him and threw
        him in chains, and a few days after he died—of rage and despair
        according to one story, of starvation if the darker tale is true.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The new king sent
        the humblest messages to the victorious Roman, hailing him as his
        <span class="tei tei-q">“father,”</span> and apologizing for all the
        woes that the ambition of Chosroës had brought upon the world.
        Heraclius received his ambassadors with kindness, and granted peace,
        on the condition that every inch of Roman territory should be
        evacuated, all Roman captives freed, a war indemnity paid, and the
        spoils of Jerusalem, including the <span class="tei tei-q">“True
        Cross,”</span> faithfully restored. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Siroes consented with alacrity, and in March,
        628, a glorious peace ended the twenty-six years of the Persian
        war.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Heraclius returned
        to Constantinople in the summer of the same year with his spoils, his
        victorious army, and his great trophy, the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Holy Wood.”</span> His entry was celebrated in the style
        of an old Roman triumph, and the Senate conferred on him the title of
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“New Scipio.”</span> The whole of the
        citizens, bearing myrtle boughs, came out to meet the army, and the
        ceremony concluded with the exhibition of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“True Cross”</span> before the high altar of St. Sophia.
        Heraclius afterwards took it back in great pomp to Jerusalem.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was, perhaps,
        the greatest triumph that any emperor ever won. Heraclius had
        surpassed the eastern achievements of Trajan and Severus, and led his
        troops further east than any Roman general had ever penetrated. His
        task, too, had been the hardest ever imposed on an emperor; none of
        his predecessors had ever started to war with his very capital
        beleaguered and with three-fourths of his provinces in the hands of
        the enemy. Since Julius Caesar no one had fought so incessantly—for
        six years the emperor had not been out of the saddle—nor met with
        such uniform success.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Heraclius returned
        to Constantinople to spend, as he hoped, the rest of his years in
        peace. He had now reached the age of fifty-four, and was much worn by
        his incessant campaigning. But the quiet for which he yearned was to
        be denied him, and the end of his reign was to be almost as
        disastrous as the commencement.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great Saracen
        invasion was at hand, and it was at the very moment of Heraclius'
        triumph that Mahomet sent out his famous circular letter to the kings
        of the earth, inviting them to embrace Islam. If the Emperor could
        but have known that his desolated realm, spoiled for ten long years
        by the Persian and the Avar, and drained of men and money, was to be
        invaded by a new enemy far more terrible than the old, he would have
        prayed that the day of his triumph might also be the day of his
        death.</p>

        Ages. There is no break at all between Constantine and Heraclius,
        though the area, character, social life, and religion of the empire
        had been greatly modified in the three hundred years that separated
        them. The new order of things, which commenced when Constantine
        established his capital on the Bosphorus, had a peaceable and orderly
        development. The first prominent fact that strikes the eye in the
        history of the three centuries is that the sceptre passed from
        sovereign to sovereign in quiet and undisturbed devolution. From the
        death of Valens onward there is no instance of a military usurper
        breaking the line of succession till the crowning of Phocas in 602.
        The emperors were either designated by their predecessors or—less
        frequently—chosen by the high officials and the senate. The
        regularity of their sequence is all <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the more astonishing when we realize that only
        in three cases in the whole period was father succeeded by son.
        Saving Constantine himself, Theodosius I., and Arcadius, not a single
        emperor left male issue; yet the hereditary instinct had grown so
        strong in the empire that nephews, sons-in-law, and brothers-in-law
        of sovereigns were gladly received as their legitimate heirs.
        Considering this tendency, it is extraordinary to note that the whole
        three hundred years did not produce a single unmitigated tyrant.
        Constantius II. was gloomy and sometimes cruel, Valens was stupid and
        avaricious, Arcadius utterly weak and inept, Justinian hard and
        thankless; but the general average of the emperors were men of
        respectable ability, and in moral character they will compare
        favourably with any list of sovereigns of similar length that any
        country can produce.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief
        modifications which must be marked in the character of the empire
        between 320 and 620 depend on two processes of gradual change which
        were going on throughout the three centuries. The first was the
        gradual de-Romanization (if we may coin the uncouth word) alike of
        the governing classes and the masses of population. In the fourth
        century the Roman impress was still strong in the East; the Latin
        language was habitually spoken by every educated man, and nearly all
        the machinery of the administration was worked in Latin phraseology.
        All law terms are habitually Latin, all titles of officers, all names
        of taxes and institutions. Writers born and bred in Greece or Asia
        still wrote in Latin <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg
        143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> as
        often as in the Greek which must have been more familiar to them.
        Ammianus Marcellinus may serve as a fair example: born in Greece, he
        wrote in the tongue of the ruling race rather than in his own idiom.
        Moreover there was still in the lands east of the Adriatic a very
        large body of Latin-speaking population—comprising all the
        inhabitants of the inland of the Balkan peninsula, for, except Greece
        proper, Macedonia, and a scattered line of cities along the Thracian
        coast, the whole land had learnt to speak the tongue of its
        conquerors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the seventh
        century this Roman element was rapidly vanishing. It is true that the
        Emperor was still hailed as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pius, Felix,
        Perpetuus, Augustus”</span>: it was not till about <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 800 that he dropped the
        old style and called himself <span class="tei tei-q">“Ἐν Χριστῷ
        πιστὸς βασιλεὺς τῶν Ῥωμαίων.”</span> Nor were the old Roman official
        titles yet disused: men were still tribunes and patricians, counts
        and praetors, but little more than the names survived. Already in the
        sixth century a knowledge of Latin was growing unusual even among
        educated men. The author Johannes Lydus tells us that he owed his
        rise in the civil service mainly to this rare accomplishment.
        Procopius, the best writer of the day and a man of real merit and
        discernment, was absolutely ignorant of the rudiments of Latin, and
        blunders when he tries to translate the simplest phrase. Justinian
        was the last emperor who spoke Latin as his mother tongue, all his
        successors were better skilled in Greek.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gradual disuse
        of Latin has its origin in the practical—though not formal—solution
        of the continuity <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg
        144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        between Rome and the East, which began with the division of the
        empire between the sons of Constantine and became more complete after
        Odoacer made himself King of Italy in 476. In the course of a century
        and a half the Latin element in the East, cut off from the
        Latin-speaking West, was bound to yield before the predominant Greek.
        But the process would have been slower if the Eastern provinces which
        spoke Latin had not been those which suffered most from the
        barbarians. The Visigoths and Ostrogoths harassed and decimated the
        Thracians, Illyrians, and Moesians, but the Slavs a century later
        almost exterminated them. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 400 probably a quarter
        of the provincials east of the Adriatic spoke Latin; in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 620 not a tenth. The
        Romanized lands of the Balkan peninsula had now become Slavonic
        principalities: only the Dalmatian seaports and a few scattered
        survivors in the Balkans still used the old tongue. The only
        districts where a considerable Latin-speaking population obeyed the
        Emperor were Africa and the Italian Exarchate, now reunited to
        Constantinople by the conquests of Justinian. But they seem to have
        been too remote from the centre of life and government to have
        exercised any influence or delayed the de-Romanizing of the East. The
        last notable author, who being a subject of the empire wrote in Latin
        as his native tongue, was the poet Flavius Corippus who addressed a
        long panegyric to Justinus II.: as might have been expected, he was
        an African.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the empire
        was losing its Roman characteristics, it was at the same time growing
        more and more <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg
        145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Christian at heart. Under Constantine and his immediate successors
        the machinery of government was only just beginning to be effected by
        the change of the emperor's religion. Though the sovereign personally
        was Christian, the system remained what it had been before. Many of
        the high officials were still pagans, and the form and spirit of all
        administrative and legal business was unaltered from what it had been
        in the third century. It is not till forty years after Constantine's
        death that we find the Christian spirit fully penetrating out of the
        spiritual into the material sphere of life. Attempts by the State to
        suppress moral sin no less than legal crime begin with Theodosius I.,
        whose crusade against sexual immorality would have been
        incomprehensible to even the best of the pagan emperors. The old
        gladiatorial shows, one of the most characteristic and repulsive
        features of Roman life, were abolished not long after. They survived
        for sixty years at Rome, though Christian Constantinople never knew
        them. But this was not the work of the State, but of a single
        individual. One day in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 404 the games had
        begun, and the gladiators were about to engage, when the monk
        Telemachus leapt down into the arena and threw himself between the
        combatants, adjuring them not to slay their brethren. There was an
        angry scuffle, and the good monk was slain. But his death had the
        effect that his protests might have failed to bring about, and no
        gladiatorial show was ever given again.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In other provinces
        of social life the work of Christianity was no less marked. It put an
        end to the detestable practice of infanticide which pervaded
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147"
        id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the ancient world, resting on
        the assumption that the father had the right to decide whether or not
        he would rear the child he had begotten. Constantine made the State
        assume the charge of feeding and rearing the children of the
        destitute, lest their parents should be tempted to cast them forth to
        perish in the old fashion, and Valentinian I. in 374 assimilated
        infanticide to other forms of murder, and made it a capital
        offence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Slavery was also
        profoundly affected by the teaching of the Church. The ancient world,
        save a few philosophers, had regarded the slave with such contempt
        that he was hardly reckoned a moral being or conceived to have rights
        or virtues. Christianity taught that he was a man with an immortal
        soul, no less than his own master, and bade slaves and freemen meet
        on terms of perfect equality around the baptismal font and before the
        sacred table. It was from the first taught that the man who
        manumitted his slaves earned the approval of heaven, and all
        occasions of rejoicing, public and private, were fitly commemorated
        by the liberation of deserving individuals. Though slavery was not
        extinguished for centuries, its evils were immensely modified;
        Justinian's legislation shows that by his time public opinion had
        condemned the characteristic evils of ancient slavery: he permitted
        the intermarriage of slaves and free persons, stipulating only for
        the consent of the owner of the servile partner in the wedlock. He
        declared the children of such mixed marriages free, and he made the
        prostitution of a slave by a master a criminal offence. Hereditary
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148"
        id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> slavery became almost unknown,
        and the institution was only kept up by the introduction of barbarian
        captives, heathens and enemies, whose position did not appeal so
        keenly to the mind of their captors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The improvement of
        the condition of all the unhappy classes of which we have been
        speaking—women, infants, slaves, gladiators—can be directly traced
        back to a single fundamental Christian truth. It was the belief in
        the importance of the individual human soul in the eyes of God that
        led the converted Roman to realize his responsibility, and change his
        attitude towards the helpless beings whom he had before despised and
        neglected. It is only fair to add that the realization of this
        central truth did not always operate for good in the Roman world of
        the fifth and sixth centuries. Some of the developments of the new
        idea were harmful and even dangerous to the State. They took the form
        of laying such exclusive stress on the relations between the
        individual soul and heaven, that the duties of man to the State were
        half forgotten. Chief among these developments was the ascetic
        monasticism which, starting from Egypt, spread rapidly all over the
        empire, more especially over its eastern provinces. When men retire
        from their duties as citizens, intent on nothing but on saving their
        own souls, take up a position outside the State, and cease to be of
        the slightest use to society, the result may be harmless so long as
        their numbers are small. But at this time the monastic impulse was
        working on such a large scale that its development was positively
        dangerous. It was by thousands and ten thousands that the men
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149"
        id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> who ought to have been bearing
        the burdens of the State, stepped aside into the monastery or the
        hermit's cave. The ascetics of the fifth century had neither of the
        justifications which made monasticism precious in a later age, they
        were neither missionaries nor men of learning. The monastery did not
        devote itself either to sending out preachers and teachers, or to
        storing up and cherishing the literary treasures of the ancient
        world. The first abbot to whom it occurred to turn the vast leisure
        of his monks to good account by setting them systematically to work
        at copying manuscripts was Cassiodorus, the ex-secretary to King
        Theodoric the Goth [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 530-40]. Before his
        time monks and books had no special connection with each other.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When a State
        contains masses of men who devote their whole energies to a
        repulsively selfish attempt to save their own individual souls, while
        letting the world around them slide on as best it may, then the body
        politic is diseased. The Roman Empire in its fight with the
        barbarians was in no small degree hampered by this attitude of so
        many of its subjects. The ascetic took the barbarian invasions as
        judgments from heaven rightly inflicted upon a wicked world, and not
        as national calamities which called on every citizen to join in the
        attempt to repel them. Many men complacently interpreted the troubles
        of the fifth century as the tribulations predicted in the Apocalypse,
        and watched them develop with something like joy, since they must
        portend the close approach of the Second Advent of our Lord.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This apathetic
        attitude of many Christians during <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the afflictions of the empire was maddening to
        the heathen minority which still survived among the educated classes.
        They roundly accused Christianity of being the ruin of the State by
        its anti-social teaching which led men to neglect every duty of the
        citizen. The Christian author Orosius felt himself compelled to write
        a lengthy history to confute this view, aiming his work at the pagan
        Symmachus whose book had been devoted to tracing all the calamities
        of the world to the conversion of Constantine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was fortunate
        for the empire that its governing classes continued to preserve the
        old traditions of Roman state-craft, and fought on doggedly against
        all the ills of their time—barbarian invasion, famine, and
        pestilence, instead of bowing to the yoke and recognizing in every
        calamity the righteous judgment of heaven and the indication of the
        approaching end of the world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Paganism had
        practically disappeared by the end of the fifth century as an active
        force; none save a few philosophers made an open profession of it,
        and in 529 Justinian put a formal end to their teaching, by closing
        the schools of Athens, the last refuge of the professors of the
        expiring religion. But if open heathenism was dead, a large measure
        of indifferentism prevailed among the educated classes: many men who
        in the fifth century would have been pagans were Christians in name
        in the sixth, but little affected by Christianity in their lives.
        This type was extremely common among the literary and official
        classes. There are plenty of sixth-century authors—Procopius may
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151"
        id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> serve as an example—whose
        works show no trace of Christian thought, though the writer was
        undoubtedly a professing member of the Church. Similar examples could
        be quoted by the dozen from among the administrators, lawyers, and
        statesmen of the day, but all were now nominally Christian. As time
        went on, such men grew rarer, and the old stern, non-religious Roman
        character passed away into the emotional and superstitious mediæval
        type of mind. The survival of pre-Christian feeling, which appeared
        as indifferentism among the educated classes, took a very different
        shape among the lower strata of society. It revealed itself in a
        crowd of gross superstitions connected with magic, witchcraft,
        fortune-telling, charms, and trivial or obscene ceremonies practised
        in secret. The State highly disapproved of such practices, treated
        them as impious or heretical, and imposed punishment on those who
        employed them: but nevertheless these contemptible survivals of
        heathenism persisted down to the latest days of the empire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been usual
        to include all the Eastern Romans of all the centuries between
        Constantine I. and Constantine XIV. in one sweeping condemnation, as
        cowardly, corrupt, and effete. The ordinary view of Byzantine life
        may be summed up in Mr. Lecky's irritating statement<a id=

        women; of poisoning, conspiracies, uniform ingratitude, perpetual
        fratricide.”</span> How Mr. Lecky obtained his universal verdict of
        history, it is hard to see: certainly that verdict can not have been
        arrived at after a study of the evidence bearing on the life of the
        persons accused. It sounds like a cheap echo of the second-hand
        historians of fifty years ago, whose staple commodity was
        Gibbon-and-water.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we must sum up
        the characteristics of the East Romans and their civilization, the
        conclusion at which we arrive will be very different. It is only fair
        to acknowledge that they had their faults: what else could be
        expected when we know that the foundations of the Eastern Empire were
        laid upon the Oriental provinces of the old Roman world, among races
        that had long been stigmatized by their masters as hopelessly effete
        and corrupt—Syrians, Egyptians, and Hellenized Asiatics, whom even
        the degenerate Romans of the third century had been wont to despise.
        The Byzantine Empire displayed from its very cradle a taint of
        weakness derived from this Oriental origin. It showed features
        particularly obnoxious to the modern mind of the nineteenth
        century—such as the practice of a degrading and grovelling court
        etiquette, full of prostrations and genuflexions, the introduction of
        eunuchs and slaves into high offices of State, the wholesale and
        deliberate use of treachery and lying in matters of diplomacy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But remembering
        its origins we shall, on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> whole, wonder at the good points in Byzantine
        civilization rather than at its faults. It may fairly be said that
        Christianity raised the Roman East to a better moral position than it
        had known for a thousand years. With all their faults the monks and
        hermits of the fifth century are a good substitute for the priests of
        Cybele and Mithras of the second. It was something that the
        Government and the public opinion of the day had concurred to sweep
        away the orgies of Daphne and Canopus. Church and State united in the
        reign of Justinian to punish with spiritual and bodily death the
        unnatural crimes which had been the open practice of emperors
        themselves in the first centuries of the empire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vices of which
        the East Romans have most commonly been accused are cowardice,
        frivolity, and treachery. On each of these points they have been
        grossly wronged. Cowardice was certainly not the chief characteristic
        of the centuries that produced emperors like Theodosius I. and
        Heraclius, prelates like Athanasius and Chrysostom, public servants
        like Belisarius and Priscus. It is not for cowardice that we note the
        Byzantine populace which routed Gainas and his mercenaries, and
        raised the <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "el"><span style="font-style: italic">Nika</span></span> sedition,
        but for turbulence. If military virtue was wanting to the East-Roman
        armies, how came the Ostrogoth and Vandal to be conquered, the
        Persian and the Hun to be driven off, how, above all, was the
        desperate struggle against the fanatical Saracen protracted for four
        hundred years, till at last the Caliphate broke up?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Frivolity and
        luxury are an accusation easy to bring against any age. Every
        moralist, from Jeremiah to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg
        155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Juvenal, and from Juvenal to Mr. Ruskin, has believed his own
        generation to be the most obnoxious and contemptible in the world's
        history. We have numerous tirades against the manners of
        Constantinople preserved in Byzantine literature, and may judge from
        them something of the faults of the time. It would seem that there
        was much of the sort of luxury to which ascetic preachers take
        exception—much splendour of raiment, much ostentatious display of
        plate and furniture, of horses and chariots. Luxury and evil living
        often go together, but when we examine all the enormities laid to the
        charge of the Byzantines, there is less alleged than we might expect.
        When Chrysostom raged against the contemporaries of Arcadius, his
        anathemas fell on such crimes as the use of cosmetics and dyes by
        fashionable dames, on the gambling propensities of their husbands, on
        the immoral tendencies of the theatre, on the drunken orgies at
        popular festivals—accusations to which any age—our own included—might
        plead guilty. The races of the Circus played a disproportionate part
        in social life, and attracted the enthusiastic attention of thousands
        of votaries; but it is surely hard that our own age, with all its
        sporting and athletic interests, should cast a stone at the sixth
        century. We have not to look far around us to discover classes for
        whom horse-racing still presents an inexplicable attraction. When we
        remember that the Constantinopolitans were excitable Orientals, and
        had no other form of sport to distract their attention from the
        Circus, we can easily realize the genesis of the famous riots of the
        Blues and Greens.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the darker
        forms of vice great cities have <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> never been free, and there is no reason to
        think that Constantinople in the sixth century differed from London
        in the nineteenth. It is fair to point out that Christian public
        opinion and the Government strove their best to put down sexual
        immorality. Theodosius and Justinian are recorded to have entered
        upon the herculean task of endeavouring to suppress all disorderly
        houses: the latter made exile the penalty for panders and
        procuresses, and inflicted death on those guilty of the worst
        extremes of immorality. We must remember, too, that if Constantinople
        showed much vice, it also displayed shining examples of the social
        virtues. The Empress Flaccilla was wont to frequent the hospitals,
        and tend the beds of the sick. Of the monastic severity which the
        Empress Pulcheria displayed in the palace we have spoken already.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After cowardice
        and light morals, it is treachery that is popularly cited as the most
        prominent vice of the Eastern Empire. There have been other states
        and epochs more given to plots and revolts, but it is still true that
        there was too much intrigue at Constantinople. The reason is not far
        to seek: the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span lang="fr" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">carrière ouverte aux
        talents</span></span>”</span> practically existed there, and the army
        and the civil service were full of poor, able, and ambitious men of
        all races and classes mixed together. The converted Goth or the
        renegade Persian, the half-civilized mountaineer from Isauria, the
        Copt and Syrian and Armenian were all welcomed in the army or civil
        service, if only they had ability. Both the bureaucracy and the army
        therefore had elements which lacked patriotism, conscience, and
        stability, and were prone to seek advancement either <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by intrigue or military revolt. This
        being granted, it is perhaps astonishing to have to record that
        between 350 and 600 the empire never once saw its legitimate ruler
        dethroned, either by palace intrigue or military revolt. The fact
        that all the plots—and there were many in the period—failed
        hopelessly, is, on the whole, a proof that if there was much
        treachery there was much loyalty among the East Romans. There have
        certainly been periods in more recent times which show a much worse
        record.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href=

        instance may suffice—Mediæval Italy from the thirteenth to the
        fifteenth century could produce far more shocking examples of
        conscienceless and unjustifiable plotting than the Byzantine Empire
        in the whole thousand years of its existence.</p>

        Saracens.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the peace of
        628 the Roman and the Persian Empires, drained of men and money, and
        ravaged from end to end by each other's marauding armies, sank down
        in exhaustion to heal them of their deadly wounds. Never before had
        either power dealt its neighbour such fearful blows as in this last
        struggle: in previous wars the contest had been waged around border
        fortresses, and the prize had been the conquest of some small slice
        of marchland. But Chosroës and Heraclius had struck deadly blows at
        the heart of each other's empire, and harried the inmost provinces up
        to the gates of each other's capitals. The Persian had turned the
        wild hordes of the Avars loose on Thrace, and the Roman had guided
        the yet wilder Chazars up to the walls of Ctesiphon. Hence it came to
        pass that at the end of the war the two powers were each weaker than
        they had ever been before. They were bleeding at every pore, utterly
        wearied and exhausted, and desirous of nothing but a long interval of
        peace to recover their lost strength.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Precisely at this
        moment a new and terrible enemy <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> fell upon the two war-worn combatants, and
        delivered an attack so vehement that it was destined to destroy the
        ancient kingdom of Persia and to shear away half the provinces of the
        Roman Empire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The politics of
        Arabia had up to this time been of little moment either to Roman or
        Persian. Each of them had allies among the Arab tribes, and had
        sometimes sent an expedition or an embassy southward, into the land
        beyond the Syrian desert. But neither of them dreamed that the
        scattered and disunited tribes of Arabia would ever combine or become
        a serious danger.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while
        Heraclius and Chosroës were harrying each other's realms events of
        world-wide importance had been taking place in the Arabian peninsula.
        For the first and last time in history there had arisen among the
        Arabs one of those world-compelling minds that are destined to turn
        aside the current of events into new channels, and change the face of
        whole continents.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mahomet, that
        strangest of moral enigmas, prophet and seer, fanatic and impostor,
        was developing his career all through the years of the Persian war.
        By an extraordinary mixture of genuine enthusiasm and vulgar cunning,
        of self-deception and deliberate imposture, of benevolence and
        cruelty, of austerity and licence, he had worked himself and his
        creed to the front. The turbulent polytheists of Arabia had by him
        been converted into a compact band of fanatics, burning to carry all
        over the world by the force of their swords their new war-cry, that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“God was God, and Mahomet His
        prophet.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg
        160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 628, the last
        year of the great war, the Arab sent his summons to Heraclius and
        Chosroës, bidding them embrace Islam. The Persian replied with the
        threat that he would put the Prophet in chains when he had leisure.
        The Roman made no direct reply, but sent Mahomet some small presents,
        neglecting the theological bent of his message, and only thinking of
        enlisting a possible political ally. Both answers were regarded as
        equally unsatisfactory by the Prophet, and he doomed the two empires
        to a similar destruction. Next year [629] the first collision between
        the East-Romans and the Arabs took place, a band of Moslems having
        pushed a raid up to Muta, near the Dead Sea. But it was not till
        three years later, when Mahomet himself was already dead, that the
        storm fell on the Roman Empire. In obedience to the injunctions of
        his deceased master, the Caliph Abu Bekr prepared two armies, and
        launched the one against Palestine and the other against Persia.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Till the last
        seven or eight years English writers have been inclined to underrate
        the force and fury of an army of Mahometan fanatics in the first
        flush of their enthusiasm. Now that we have witnessed in our own day
        the scenes of Tamaai and Abu Klea we do so no longer. The rush that
        can break into a British square bristling with Martini-Henry rifles
        is not a thing to be despised. For the future we shall not treat
        lightly the armies of the early Caliphs, nor scoff with Gibbon at the
        feebleness of the troops who were routed by them. If the soldiers of
        Queen Victoria, armed with modern rifles and artillery, found the
        fanatical Arab a formidable foe, let us not blame <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the soldiers of Heraclius who faced the
        same enemy with pike and sword alone. In the early engagements
        between the East-Romans and the Saracens the superior discipline and
        more regular arms of the one were not a sufficient counterpoise to
        put against the mad recklessness of the other. The Moslem wanted to
        get killed, that he might reap the fruits of martyrdom in the other
        world, and cared not how he died, if he had first slain an enemy. The
        Roman fought well enough; but he did not, like his adversary, yearn
        to become a martyr, and the odds were on the man who held his life
        the cheapest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The moment of the
        Saracen invasion was chosen most unhappily for Heraclius. He had just
        paid off the enormous debt that he had contracted to the Church, and
        to do so had not only drained the treasury but imposed some new and
        unwise taxes on the harassed provincials, and disbanded many of his
        veterans for the sake of economy. Syria and Egypt, after spending
        twelve and ten years respectively under the Persian yoke, had not yet
        got back into their old organization. Both countries were much
        distracted with religious troubles; the heretical sects of the
        Monophysites and Jacobites who swarmed within their boundaries had
        lifted up their heads under the Persian rule, being relieved from the
        governmental repression that had hitherto been their lot. They seem
        to have constituted an actual majority of the population, and
        bitterly resented the endeavours of Heraclius to enforce orthodoxy in
        the reconquered provinces. Their discontent was so bitter that during
        the Saracen invasion they stood aside and refused to <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> help the imperial armies, or even on
        occasion aided the alien enemy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The details of the
        Arab conquest of Syria have not been preserved by the East-Roman
        historians, who seem to have hated the idea of recording the
        disasters of Christendom. The Moslems, on the other hand, had not yet
        commenced to write, and ere historians arose among them, the tale of
        the invasion had been intertwined with a whole cycle of romantic
        legends, fitter for the <span class="tei tei-q">“Arabian
        Nights”</span> than the sober pages of a chronicle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the main lines
        of the war can be reconstructed with accuracy. The Saracen horde
        under Abu Obeida emerged from the desert in the spring of 634 and
        captured Bostra, the frontier city of Syria to the east, by the aid
        of treachery from within. The Romans collected an army to drive them
        off, but in July it was defeated at Aijnadin [Gabatha] in Ituraea.
        Thoroughly roused by this disaster Heraclius set all the legions of
        the East marching, and sixty thousand men crossed the Jordan and
        advanced to recover Bostra. The Arabs met them at the fords of the
        Hieromax, an Eastern tributary of the Jordan, and a fierce battle
        raged all day. The Romans drove the enemy back to the very gates of
        their camp, but a last charge, headed by the fierce warrior Khaled,
        broke their firm array when a victory seemed almost assured. All the
        mailed horsemen of Heraclius, his Armenian and Isaurian archers, his
        solid phalanx of infantry, were insufficient to resist the wild rush
        of the Arabs. Urged on by the cry of their general, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Paradise is before you, the devil and hell-fire
        behind,”</span> the fanatical <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Orientals threw themselves on regiment after
        regiment and drove it off the field.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All Syria east of
        Jordan was lost in this fatal battle. Damascus, its great stronghold,
        resisted desperately but fell early in 635. Most of its population
        were massacred. This disaster drew Heraclius into the field, though
        he was now over sixty, and was beginning to fail in health. He could
        do nothing; Emesa and Heliopolis were sacked before his eyes, and
        after an inglorious campaign he hurried to Jerusalem, took the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“True Cross”</span> from its sanctuary, where
        he had replaced it in triumph five years before, and retired to
        Constantinople. Hardly had he reached it when the news arrived that
        his discontented and demoralized troops had proclaimed a rebel
        emperor, though the enemy was before them. The rebel—his name was
        Baanes—was put down, but meanwhile Antioch, Chalcis, and all Northern
        Syria fell into the hands of the Arabs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Worse yet was to
        follow. In the next year, 637, Jerusalem fell, after a desperate
        resistance, protracted for more than twelve months. The inhabitants
        refused to surrender except to the Caliph in person, and the aged
        Omar came over the desert, proud to take possession of the city which
        Mahomet had reckoned the holiest site on earth save Mecca alone. The
        Patriarch Sophronius was commanded to guide the conqueror around the
        city, and when he saw the rude Arab standing by the altar of the
        Church of the Holy Sepulchre, cried aloud, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Now is the Abomination of Desolation, which was spoken
        of by Daniel the prophet, truly in the Holy Place.”</span> The Caliph
        did <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name=
        "Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> not confiscate any of
        the great Christian sanctuaries, but he took the site of Solomon's
        Temple, and erected on it a magnificent Mosque, known ever since as
        the Mosque of Omar.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tale of the
        last years of Heraclius is most melancholy. The Emperor lay at
        Constantinople slowly dying of dropsy, and his eldest son Constantine
        had to take the field in his stead. But the young prince received a
        crushing defeat in 638, when he attempted to recover North Syria, and
        next year the Arabs, under Amrou, pressed eastward across the Isthmus
        of Suez, and threw themselves upon Egypt. Two years more of fighting
        sufficed to conquer the granary of the Roman Empire; and in February,
        641, when Heraclius died, the single port of Alexandria was the sole
        remaining possession of the Romans in Egypt.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ten years' war
        which had torn Syria and Egypt from the hands of the unfortunate
        Heraclius had been even more fatal to his Eastern neighbour. The
        Arabs had attacked the Persian kingdom at the same moment that they
        fell on Syria: two great battles at Kadesia [636] and Yalulah [637]
        sufficed to place all Western Persia in the hands of the Moslems.
        King Isdigerd, the last of the Sassanian line, raised his last army
        in 641, and saw it cut to pieces at the decisive field of Nehauend.
        He fled away to dwell as an exile among the Turks, and all his
        kingdom as far as the borders of India became the prey of the
        conquerors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Heraclius had
        married twice; by his first wife, Eudocia, he left a single son,
        Constantine, who should <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg
        165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        have been his sole heir. But he had taken a second wife, and this
        wife was his own niece Martina. The incestuous choice had provoked
        much scandal, and was the one grave offence which could be brought
        against Heraclius, whose life was in other respects blameless.
        Martina, an ambitious and intriguing woman, prevailed on her aged
        husband to make her eldest son, Heracleonas, joint-heir with his half
        brother Constantine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This arrangement,
        as might have been expected, worked very badly. The court and army
        was at once split up between the adherents of the two young Emperors,
        and while the defence of the empire against the Saracens should have
        been the sole care of the East-Romans, they found themselves
        distracted by fierce Court intrigues. Armed strife between the
        Emperors seemed destined to break out, but after reigning only a few
        months Constantine III. died. It was rumoured far and wide that his
        step-mother had poisoned him, to make the way clear for her own son
        Heracleonas, who immediately proclaimed himself sole emperor. The
        senate and the Byzantine populace were both highly indignant at this
        usurpation, for the deceased Constantine left a young son named
        Constans, who was thus excluded from the throne to which he was the
        natural heir. Heracleonas had reigned alone no more than a few weeks
        when the army of the East and the mob of Constantinople were heard
        demanding in angry tones that Constans should be crowned as his
        uncle's colleague. Heracleonas was frightened into compliance, but
        his submission only saved him for a year. In the summer <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of 642 the senate decreed his deposition,
        and he was seized by the adherents of Constans and sent into exile,
        along with his mother Martina. The victorious faction very cruelly
        ordered the tongue of the mother and the nose of the son to be
        slit—the first instance of that hateful Oriental practice being
        applied to members of the royal house, but not the last.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Constans II. was
        sole emperor from 642 to 668, and his son and successor, Constantine
        IV., reigned from 668 to 685. They were both strong, hard-headed
        warrior princes, fit descendants of the gallant Heraclius. Their main
        credit lies in the fact that they fought unceasingly against the
        Saracen, and preserved as a permanent possession of the empire nearly
        every province that they had still remained Roman at the death of
        Heraclius. During the minority indeed of Constans II.,
        Alexandria<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href=
        "#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> and
        Aradus, the two last ports preserved by the Romans in Egypt and Syria
        were lost. But the Saracens advanced no further by land; the sands of
        the African desert and the passes of Taurus were destined to hold
        them back for many years. The times, however, were still dangerous
        till the murder of the Caliph Othman in 656, after which the outbreak
        of the first civil war among the Moslems—the contest of Ali and
        Moawiah for the Caliphate—gave the empire a respite. Moawiah, who
        held the lands on the Roman frontier—his rival's power lying further
        to the east—secured a free hand against Ali, by making <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> peace with Constans. He even consented to
        pay him a small annual subsidy so long as the truce should last. This
        agreement was invaluable to the empire. After twenty-seven years of
        incessant war the mangled realm at last obtained an interval of
        repose. It was something, too, that the Saracens were induced to
        pause, and saw that the extension of their conquests was not destined
        to spread at once over the whole world. When they realized that their
        victories were not to go on for ever, they lost the first keenness of
        the fanatical courage which had made them so terrible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Freed from the
        Saracen war, which had threatened not merely to curtail, but to
        extinguish the empire, Constans was at liberty to turn his attention
        to other matters. It seems probable that it was at this moment that
        the reorganization of the provinces of the empire took place, which
        we find in existence in the second half of the seventh century. The
        old Roman names and boundaries, which had endured since Diocletian's
        time, now disappear, and the empire is found divided into new
        provinces with strange denominations. They were military in their
        origin, and each consisted of the district covered by a large unit of
        soldiery—what we should call an army corps. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Theme”</span> meant both the corps and the district
        which it defended, and the corps-commander was also the provincial
        governor. There were six corps in Asia, called the Armeniac,
        Anatolic, Thracesian, Bucellarian, Cibyrrhæot, and Obsequian themes.
        Of these the first two explain themselves, they were the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“army of Armenia”</span> and the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“army of the East”</span>; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the Obsequian theme, quartered along the
        Propontis, was so called because it was a kind of personal guard for
        the Emperor and the home districts. The Thracesians were the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Army of Thrace,”</span> who in the stress of
        the war had been drafted across to Asia to reinforce the Eastern
        troops. The Bucellarii seem to have been corps composed of natives
        and barbarian auxiliaries mixed; they are heard of long before
        Constans, and he probably did no more than unite them and localize
        them in a single district. The Cibyrrhæot theme alone gets its name
        from a town, the port of Cibyra in Pamphylia, which must have been
        the original headquarters of the South-Western Army Corps. Its
        commander had a fleet always in his charge, and his troops were often
        employed as marines.<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href=
        "#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The western half
        of the empire seems to have had six <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Themes”</span> also; they bear however old and familiar
        names—Thrace, Hellas, Thessalonica, Ravenna, Sicily, and Africa, and
        their names explain their boundaries. In both halves of the empire
        there were, beside the great themes, smaller districts under the
        command of military governors, who had charge of outlying posts, such
        as the passes of Taurus, or the islands of Cyprus and Sardinia. Some
        of these afterwards grew into independent themes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus came to an
        end the old imperial system of dividing military authority and civil
        jurisdiction, which Augustus had invented and Diocletian perpetuated.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169"
        id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Under stress of the fearful
        Saracenic invasion the civil governors disappear, and for the future
        a commander chosen for his military capacity has also to discharge
        civil functions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Constans II., when
        once he had made peace with Moawiah, would have done well to turn to
        the Balkan Peninsula, and evict the Slavs from the districts south of
        Haemus into which they had penetrated during the reign of Heraclius.
        But he chose instead to do no more than compel the Slavs to pay
        homage to him and give tribute, and set out to turn westward, and
        endeavour to drive the Lombards out of Italy. Falling on the Duchy of
        Benevento, he took many towns, and even laid siege to the capital.
        But he failed to take it, and passed on to Rome, which had not seen
        the face of an emperor for two hundred years. When an emperor did
        appear he brought no luck, for Constans signalized his visit by
        taking down the bronze tiles of the Pantheon and sending them off to
        Constantinople [664].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Emperor
        lingered no less than five years in the West, busied with the affairs
        of Italy and Africa, till the Constantinopolitans began to fear that
        he would make Rome or Syracuse his capital. But in 668 he was
        assassinated in a most strange manner. <span class="tei tei-q">“As he
        bathed in the baths called Daphne, Andreas his bathing attendant
        smote him on the head with his soap-box, and fled away.”</span> The
        blow was fatal, Constans died, and Constantine his son reigned in his
        stead.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Constantine IV.,
        known as Pogonatus, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Bearded,”</span>
        reigned for seventeen years, of which more than half were spent in
        one long struggle with the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg
        170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Saracens. Moawiah, the first of the Ommeyades, had now made himself
        sole Caliph; the civil wars of the Arabs were now over, and once more
        they fell on the empire. Constantine's reign opened disastrously,
        with simultaneous attacks by the armies and fleets of Moawiah on
        Africa, Sicily, and Asia Minor. But this was only the prelude; in 673
        the Caliph made ready an expedition, the like of which had never yet
        been undertaken by the Saracens. A great fleet and land army started
        from Syria to undertake the siege of Constantinople itself, an
        enterprise which the Moslems had not yet attempted. It was headed by
        the general Abderrahman, and accompanied by Yezid, the Caliph's son
        and heir. The fleet beat the imperial navy off the sea, forced the
        passage of the Dardanelles, and took Cyzicus. Using that city as its
        base, it proceeded to blockade the Bosphorus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great glory of
        Constantine IV. is that he withstood, defeated, and drove away the
        mighty armament of Moawiah. For four years the investment of
        Constantinople lingered on, and the stubborn resistance of the
        garrison seemed unable to do more than stave off the evil day. But
        the happy invention of fire-tubes for squirting inflammable liquids
        (probably the famous <span class="tei tei-q">“Greek-fire”</span> of
        which we first hear at this time), gave the Emperor's fleet the
        superiority in a decisive naval battle. At the same time a great
        victory was won on land and thirty thousand Arabs slain. Abderrahman
        had fallen during the siege, and his successors had to lead back the
        mere wrecks of a fleet and army to the disheartened Caliph.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a thousand
        pities that the details of this, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> second great siege of Constantinople, are not
        better known. But there is no good contemporary historian to give us
        the desired information. If he had but met with his <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“sacred bard,”</span> Constantine IV. might have gone
        down to posterity in company with Heraclius and Leo the Isaurian, as
        the third great hero of the East-Roman Empire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The year after the
        raising of the great siege, Moawiah sued for peace, restored all his
        conquests, and offered a huge war indemnity, promising to pay 3000
        lbs. of gold per annum for thirty years. The report of the triumph of
        Constantine went all over the world, and ambassadors came even from
        the distant Franks and Khazars to congratulate him on the victory
        which had saved Eastern Christendom from the Arab.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Constantine
        was defending his capital from the Eastern enemy, the wild tribes of
        his northern border took the opportunity of swooping down on the
        European provinces, whose troops had been drawn off to resist the
        Arabs. The Slavs came down from the inland, and laid siege for two
        years to Thessalonica, which was only relieved from their attacks
        when Constantine had finished his war with Moawiah. But a far more
        dangerous attack was made by another enemy in the eastern part of the
        Balkan Peninsula. The Bulgarians, a nomad tribe of Finnish blood, who
        dwelt in the region of the Pruth and Dniester, came over the Danube,
        subdued the Slavs of Moesia, and settled between the Danube and the
        Eastern Balkans, where they have left their name till this day. They
        united the scattered Slavonic tribes <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the region into a single strong state, and
        the new Bulgarian kingdom was long destined to be a troublesome
        neighbour to the empire. The date 679 counts as the first year of the
        reign of Isperich first king of Bulgaria. Constantine IV. was too
        exhausted by his long war with Moawiah to make any serious attempt to
        drive the Bulgarians back over the Danube, and acquiesced in the new
        settlement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last six years
        of Constantine's reign were spent in peace. The only notable event
        that took place in them was the meeting at Constantinople of the
        Sixth Oecumenical Council in 680-1. At this Synod, the doctrine of
        the Monothelites, who attributed but one will to Our Lord, was
        solemnly condemned by the united Churches of the East and West. The
        holders of Monothelite doctrines, dead and alive, were solemnly
        anathematised, among them Pope Honorius of Rome, who in a previous
        generation had consented to the heresy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Constantine IV.
        died in 685, before he had reached his thirty-sixth year, leaving his
        throne to his eldest son Justinian, a lad of sixteen.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 173%">XIII. The First Anarchy.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justinian II., the
        last of the house of Heraclius, was a sovereign of a different type
        from any emperor that we have yet encountered in the annals of the
        Eastern Empire. He was a bold, reckless, callous, and selfish young
        man, with a firm determination to assert his own individuality and
        have his own way,—he was, in short, of the stuff of which tyrants are
        made. Justinian was but seventeen when he came to the throne, but he
        soon showed that he intended to rule the empire after his own good
        pleasure long before he had begun to learn the lessons of
        state-craft.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ere he had reached
        his twenty-first year Justinian had plunged into war with the
        Bulgarians. He attacked them suddenly, inflicted several defeats on
        their king, and took no less than thirty thousand prisoners, whom he
        sent over to Asia, and forced to enlist in the army of Armenia. He
        next picked a quarrel with the Saracen Caliph on the most frivolous
        grounds. The annual tribute due by the treaty of 679 had hitherto
        been paid in Roman <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">solidi</span></span>, but in
        692 <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name=
        "Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Abdalmalik tendered it
        in new gold coins of his own mintage, bearing verses of the Koran.
        Justinian refused to receive them, and declared war.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His second venture
        in the field was disastrous: his unwilling recruits from Bulgaria
        deserted to the enemy, when he met the Saracens at Sebastopolis in
        Cilicia, and the Roman army was routed with great slaughter. The two
        subsequent campaigns were equally unsuccessful, and the troops of the
        Caliph harried Cappadocia far and wide.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justinian's wars
        depleted his treasury; yet he persisted in plunging into expensive
        schemes of building at the same time, and was driven to collect money
        by the most reckless extortion. He employed two unscrupulous
        ministers, Theodotus, the accountant general—an ex-abbot who had
        deserted his monastery—and the eunuch Stephanus, the keeper of the
        privy purse. These men were to Justinian what Ralph Flambard was to
        William Rufus, or Empson and Dudley to Henry VII: they raised him
        funds by flagrant extortion and illegal stretching of the law. Both
        were violent and cruel: Theodotus is said to have hung recalcitrant
        tax-payers up by ropes above smoky fires till they were nearly
        stifled. Stephanus thrashed and stoned every one who fell into his
        hands; he is reported to have actually administered a whipping to the
        empress-dowager during the absence of her son, and Justinian did not
        punish him when he returned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
        emperor's financial expedients were making him hated by the moneyed
        classes, he was rendering himself no less unpopular in the
        army.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg
        175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After his
        ill-success in the Saracen war, he began to execute or imprison his
        officers, and to decimate his beaten troops: to be employed by him in
        high command was almost as dangerous as it was to be appointed a
        general-in-chief during the dictatorship of Robespierre.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 695 the cup of
        Justinian's iniquities was full. An officer named Leontius being
        appointed, to his great dismay, general of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“theme”</span> of Hellas, was about to set out to assume
        his command. As he parted from his friends he exclaimed that his days
        were numbered, and that he should be expecting the order for his
        execution to arrive at any moment. Then a certain monk named Paul
        stood forth, and bade him save himself by a bold stroke; if he would
        aim a blow at Justinian he would find the people and the army ready
        to follow him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leontius took the
        monk's counsel, and rushing to the state prison, at the head of a few
        friends, broke it open and liberated some hundreds of political
        prisoners. A mob joined him, he seized the Cathedral of St. Sophia,
        and then marched on the palace. No one would fight for Justinian, who
        was caught and brought before the rebel leader in company with his
        two odious ministers. Leontius bade his nose be slit, and banished
        him to Cherson. Theodotus and Stephanus he handed over to the mob,
        who dragged them round the city and burnt them alive.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Twenty years of
        anarchy followed the usurpation of Leontius. The new emperor was not
        a man of capacity, and had been driven into rebellion by his fears
        rather than his ambition. He held the throne <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> barely three years, amid constant revolts at
        home and defeats abroad. The Asiatic frontier was ravaged by the
        armies of Abdalmalik, and at the same time a great disaster befel the
        western half of the empire. A Saracen army from Egypt forced its way
        into Africa, where the Romans had still maintained themselves by hard
        fighting while the emperors of the house of Heraclius reigned. They
        reduced all its fortresses one after the other, and finally took
        Carthage in 697—a hundred and sixty-five years after it had been
        restored to the empire by Belisarius.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The larger part of
        the army of Africa escaped by sea from Carthage when the city fell.
        The officers in command sailed for Constantinople, and during their
        voyage plotted to dethrone Leontius. They enlisted in their scheme
        Tiberius Apsimarus, who commanded the imperial fleet in the Aegean,
        and proclaimed him emperor when he joined them with his galleys. The
        troops of Leontius betrayed the gates of the capital to the followers
        of the rebel admiral, and Apsimarus seized Constantinople. He
        proclaimed himself emperor by the title of Tiberius, third of that
        name, and condemned his captive rival to the same fate that he
        himself had inflicted on Justinian II. Accordingly the nose of
        Leontius was slit, and he was placed in confinement in a
        monastery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tiberius III. was
        more fortunate in his reign than his predecessor: his troops gained
        several victories over the Saracens, recovered the frontier districts
        which Justinian II. and Leontius had lost, and even invaded Northern
        Syria. But these successes did not save Tiberius from suffering the
        same doom which had fallen on Justinian and Leontius. The people and
        army were out of hand, the ephemeral emperor could count on no
        loyalty, and any shock was sufficient to upset his precarious
        throne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must now turn
        to the banished Justinian, who had been sent into exile with his nose
        mutilated. He had been transported to Cherson, the Greek town in the
        Crimea, close to the modern Sebastopol, which formed the northernmost
        outpost of civilization, and enjoyed municipal liberty under the
        suzerainty of the empire. Justinian displayed in his day of adversity
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178"
        id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a degree of capacity which
        astonished his contemporaries. He fled from Cherson and took refuge
        with the Khan of the Khazars, the Tartar tribe who dwelt east of the
        Sea of Azof. With this prince the exile so ingratiated himself that
        he received in marriage his sister, who was baptized and christened
        Theodora. But Tiberius III. sent great sums of money to the Khazar to
        induce him to surrender Justinian, and the treacherous barbarian
        determined to accept the bribe, and sent secret orders to two of his
        officers to seize his brother-in-law. The emperor learnt of the plot
        through his wife, and saved himself by the bold expedient of going at
        once to one of the two Khazar chiefs and asking for a secret
        interview. When they were alone he fell on him and strangled him, and
        then calling on the second Khazar served him in the same fashion,
        before the Khan's orders had been divulged to any one.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This gave him time
        to escape, and he fled in a fishing boat out into the Euxine with a
        few friends and servants who had followed him into exile. While they
        were out at sea a storm arose, and the boat began to fill. One of his
        companions cried to Justinian to make his peace with God, and pardon
        his enemies ere he died. But the Emperor's stern soul was not bent by
        the tempest. <span class="tei tei-q">“May God drown me here,”</span>
        he answered, <span class="tei tei-q">“if I spare a single one of my
        enemies if ever I get to land!”</span> The boat weathered the storm,
        and Justinian survived to carry out his cruel oath. He came ashore in
        the land of the Bulgarians, and soon won favour with their king
        Terbel, who wanted a good excuse for invading the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> empire, and found it in the pretence of
        supporting the exiled monarch. With a Bulgarian army at his back
        Justinian appeared before Constantinople, and obtained an entrance at
        night near the gate of Blachernæ. There was no fighting, for the
        adherents of Tiberius were as unready to strike a blow for their
        master as the followers of Leontius had been [705 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>]</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So Justinian
        recovered his throne without fighting, for the people had by this
        time half forgotten his tyranny, and regretted the rule of the house
        of Heraclius. But they were soon to find out that they had erred in
        submitting to the exile, and should have resisted him at all hazards.
        Justinian came back in a relentless mood, bent on nothing but
        revenging his mutilated nose and his ten years of exile. His first
        act was to send for the two usurpers who had sat on his throne:
        Leontius was brought out from his monastery, and Tiberius caught as
        he tried to flee into Asia. Justinian had them led round the city in
        chains, and then bound them side by side before his throne in the
        Cathisma, the imperial box at the Hippodrome. There he sat in state,
        using their prostrate bodies as a footstool, while his adherents
        chanted the verse from the ninety-first Psalm, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thou shalt tread on the lion and asp: the young lion and
        dragon shalt thou trample under thy feet.”</span> The allusion was to
        the names of the usurpers, the Lion and Asp being Leontius and
        Apsimarus!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this strange
        exhibition the two ex-emperors were beheaded. Their execution began a
        reign of terror, for Justinian had his oath to keep, and was set
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180"
        id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> on wreaking vengeance on every
        one who had been concerned in his deposition. He hanged all the chief
        officers and courtiers of Leontius, and put out the eyes of the
        patriarch who had crowned him. Then he set to work to hunt out meaner
        victims: many prominent citizens of Constantinople were sown up in
        sacks and drowned in the Bosphorus. Soldiers were picked out by the
        dozen and beheaded. A special expedition was sent by sea to sack
        Cherson, the city of the Emperor's exile, because he had a grudge
        against its citizens. The chief men were caught and sent to the
        capital, where Justinian had them bound to spits and roasted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These atrocities
        were mere samples of the general conduct of Justinian. In a few years
        he had made himself so much detested that it might be said that he
        had been comparatively popular in the days of his first reign.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The end came into
        711, when a general named Philippicus took arms, and seized
        Constantinople while Justinian was absent at Sinope. The army of the
        tyrant laid down their arms when Philippicus approached, and he was
        led forth and beheaded without further delay—an end too good for such
        a monster. The conqueror also sought out and slew his little son
        Tiberius, whom the sister of the Khan of the Khazars had borne to him
        during his exile. So ended the house of Heraclius, after it had sat
        for five generations and one hundred and one years on the throne of
        Constantinople.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The six years
        which followed were purely anarchical. Justinian's wild and wicked
        freaks had completed the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg
        181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        demoralization which had already set in before his restoration.
        Everything in the army and the state was completely disorganized and
        out of gear. It required a hero to restore the machinery of
        government and evolve order out of chaos. But the hero was not at
        once forthcoming, and the confusion went on increasing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To replace
        Justinian by Philippicus was only to substitute King Log for King
        Stork. The new emperor was a mere man of pleasure, and spent his time
        in personal enjoyment, letting affairs of state slide on as best they
        might. In less than two years he was upset by a conspiracy which
        placed on the throne Artemius Anastasius, his own chief secretary.
        Philippicus was blinded, and compelled to exchange the pleasures of
        the palace for the rigours of a monastery. But the Court intrigue
        which dethroned Philippicus did not please the army, and within two
        years Anastasius was overthrown by the soldiers of the Obsequian
        theme, who gave the imperial crown to Theodosius of Adrammytium, a
        respectable but obscure commissioner of taxes. More merciful than any
        of his ephemeral predecessors, Theodosius III. dismissed Anastasius
        unharmed, after compelling him to take holy orders.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the
        organization of the empire was visibly breaking up. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The affairs both of the realm and the city were
        neglected and decaying, civil education was disappearing, and
        military discipline dissolved.”</span> The Bulgarian and Saracen
        commenced once more to ravage the frontier provinces, and every year
        their ravages penetrated further inland. The <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Caliph Welid was so impressed with the
        opportunity offered to him, that he commenced to equip a great
        armament in the ports of Syria with the express purpose of laying
        siege to Constantinople. No one hindered him, for the army raised to
        serve against him turned aside to engage in the civil war between
        Anastasius and Theodosius. The landmarks of the Saracens' conquests
        by land are found in the falls of the great cities of Tyana [710],
        Amasia [712], and Antioch-in-Pisidia [713]. They had penetrated into
        Phrygia by 716, and were besieging the fortress of Amorium with every
        expectation of success, when at last there appeared the man who was
        destined to save the East-Roman Empire from a premature
        dismemberment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was Leo the
        Isaurian, one of the few military officers who had made a great
        reputation amid the fearful disasters of the last ten years. He was
        now general of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Anatolic”</span> theme,
        the province which included the old Cappadocia and Lycaonia. After
        inducing the Saracens, more by craft than force, to raise the siege
        of Amorium, Leo disowned his allegiance to the incapable Theodosius
        and marched toward the Bosphorus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The unfortunate
        emperor, who had not coveted the throne he occupied, nor much desired
        to retain it, allowed his army to risk one engagement with the troops
        of Leo. When it was beaten he summoned the Patriarch, the Senate, and
        the chief officers of the court, pointed out to them that a great
        Saracen invasion was impending, that civil war had begun, and that he
        himself did not wish to remain responsible <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> for the conduct of affairs. With his consent
        the assembly resolved to offer the crown to Leo, who formally
        accepted it early in the spring of 717.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Theodosius retired
        unharmed to Ephesus, where he lived for many years. When he died the

        Back.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By dethroning
        Theodosius III. on the very eve of the great Saracen invasion, Leo
        the Isaurian took upon himself the gravest of responsibilities. With
        a demoralized army, which of late had been more accustomed to revolt
        than to fight, a depleted treasury, and a disorganized civil service,
        he had to face an attack even more dangerous than that which
        Constantine IV. had beaten off thirty years before. Constantine too,
        the fourth of a race of hereditary rulers, had a secure throne and a
        loyal army, while Leo was a mere adventurer who had seized the crown
        only a few months before he was put to the test of the sword.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reigning
        Caliph was now Suleiman, the seventh of the house of the Ommeyades.
        He had strained all the resources of his wide empire to provide a
        fleet and army adequate to the great enterprise which he had taken in
        hand. The chief command of the expedition was given to his brother
        Moslemah, who led an army of eighty thousand men from Tarsus across
        the centre of Asia Minor, and marched on <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the Hellespont, taking the strong city of
        Pergamus on his way. Meanwhile a fleet of eighteen hundred sail under
        the vizier Suleiman, namesake of his master the Caliph, sailed from
        Syria for the Aegean, carrying a force no less than that which
        marched by land. Fleet and army met at Abydos on the Hellespont
        without mishap, for Leo had drawn back all his resources, naval and
        military, to guard his capital.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In August, 717,
        only five months after his coronation, the Isaurian saw the vessels
        of the Saracens sailing up the Propontis, while their army had
        crossed into Thrace and was approaching the city from the western
        side. Moslemah caused his troops to build a line of circumvallation
        from the sea to the Golden Horn, cutting Constantinople off from all
        communication with Thrace, while Suleiman blocked the southern exit
        of the Bosphorus, and tried to close it on the northern side also, so
        as to prevent any supplies coming by water from the Euxine. Leo,
        however, sallied forth from the Golden Horn with his galleys and
        fire-vessels bearing the dreaded Greek fire, and did so much harm to
        the detachment of Saracen ships which had gone northward up the
        strait, that the blockade was never properly established on that
        side.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Saracens
        relied more on starving out the city than on taking it by storm: they
        had come provided with everything necessary for a blockade of many
        months, and sat down as if intending to remain before the walls for
        an indefinite time. But Constantinople had been provisioned on an
        even more lavish scale; each family had been bidden to lay in a stock
        of corn <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name=
        "Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> for no less a period
        than two years, and famine appeared in the camp of the besiegers long
        ere it was felt in the houses of the besieged. Nor had Moslemah and
        Suleiman reckoned with the climate. Hard winters occasionally occur
        by the Black Sea, as our own army learnt to its cost in the Crimean
        War. But the Saracens were served even worse by the winter of 717-18,
        when the frost never ceased for twelve weeks. Leo might have boasted,
        like Czar Nicholas, that December, January, and February were his
        best generals—for these months wrought fearful havoc in the Saracen
        host. The lightly clad Orientals could not stand the weather, and
        died off like flies of dysentery and cold. The vizier Suleiman was
        among those who perished. Meanwhile the Byzantines suffered little,
        being covered by roofs all the winter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When next spring
        came round Moslemah would have had to raise the siege if he had not
        been heavily reinforced both by sea and land. A fleet of reserve
        arrived from Egypt, and a large army came up from Tarsus and occupied
        the Asiatic shores of the Bosphorus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Leo did not
        despair, and took the offensive in the summer. His fire-ships stole
        out and burnt the Egyptian squadron as it lay at anchor. A body of
        troops landing on the Bithynian coast, surprised and cut to pieces
        the Saracen army which watched the other side of the strait. Soon,
        too, famine began to assail the enemy; their stores of provisions
        were now giving out, and they had harried the neighbourhood so
        fiercely that no more food could be got from near at <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> hand, while if they sent foraging parties
        too far from their lines they were cut off by the peasantry. At last
        Moslemah suffered a disaster which compelled him to abandon his task.
        The Bulgarians came down over the Balkans, and routed the covering
        army which observed Adrianople and protected the siege on the western
        side. No less than twenty thousand Saracens fell, by the testimony of
        the Arab historians themselves, and the survivors were so cowed that
        Moslemah gave the order to retire. The fleet ferried the land army
        back into Asia, and both forces started homeward. Moslemah got back
        to Tarsus with only thirty thousand men at his back, out of more than
        a hundred thousand who had started with him or come to him as
        reinforcements. The fleet fared even worse: it was caught by a
        tempest in the Aegean, and so fearfully shattered that it is said
        that only five vessels out of the whole Armada got back to Syria
        unharmed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus ended the
        last great endeavour of the Saracen to destroy Constantinople. The
        task was never essayed again, though for three hundred and fifty
        years more wars were constantly breaking out between the Emperor and
        the Caliph. In the future they were always to be border struggles,
        not desperate attempts to strike at the heart of the empire, and
        conquer Europe for Islam. To Leo, far more than to his contemporary
        the Frank Charles Martel, is the delivery of Christendom from the
        Moslem danger to be attributed. Charles turned back a plundering
        horde sent out from an outlying province of the Caliphate. Leo
        repulsed the grand-army of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg
        188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        Saracens, raised from the whole of their eastern realms, and
        commanded by the brother of their monarch. Such a defeat was well
        calculated to impress on their fatalistic minds the idea that
        Constantinople was not destined by providence to fall into their
        hands. They were by this time far removed from the frantic fanaticism
        which had inspired their grandfathers, and the crushing disaster they
        had now sustained deterred them from any repetition of the attempt.
        Life and power had grown so pleasant to them that martyrdom was no
        longer an <span class="tei tei-q">“end in itself”</span>; they
        preferred, if checked, to live and fight another day.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leo was, however,
        by no means entirely freed from the Saracens by his victory of 718.
        At several epochs in the latter part of his reign he was troubled by
        invasions of his border provinces. None of them, however, were really
        dangerous, and after a victory won over the main army of the raiders
        in 739 at Acroinon in Phrygia, Asia Minor was finally freed from
        their presence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If Leo the
        Isaurian had died on the day on which the army of the Caliph raised
        the siege of Constantinople it would have been well for his
        reputation in history. Unhappily for himself, though happily enough
        for the East-Roman realm, he survived yet twenty years to carry
        through a series of measures which were in his eyes not less
        important than the repulse of the Moslems from his capital.
        Historians have given to the scheme of reform which he took in hand
        the name of the Iconoclastic movement, because of the opposition to
        the worship of images which formed one of the most prominent features
        of his action.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the last
        hundred years the empire had been declining in culture and
        civilization; literature and art seemed likely to perish in the
        never-ending clash of arms: the old-Roman jurisprudence was being
        forgotten, the race of educated civil servants was showing signs of
        extinction, the governors of provinces were now without exception
        rough soldiers, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg
        190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> not
        members of that old bureaucracy whose Roman traditions had so long
        kept the empire together. Not least among the signs of a decaying
        civilization were the gross superstitions which had grown up of late
        in the religious world. Christianity had begun to be permeated by
        those strange mediæval fancies which would have been as inexplicable
        to the old-Roman mind of four centuries before as they are to the
        mind of the nineteenth century. A rich crop of puerile legends,
        rites, and observances had grown up of late around the central truths
        of religion, unnoticed and unguarded against by theologians, who
        devoted all their energies to the barren Monothelite and Monophysite
        controversies. Image-worship and relic-worship in particular had
        developed with strange rapidity, and assumed the shape of mere
        Fetishism. Every ancient picture or statue was now announced as both
        miraculously produced and endued with miraculous powers. These
        wonder-working pictures and statues were now adored as things in
        themselves divine: the possession of one of them made the fortune of
        a church or monastery, and the tangible object of worship seems to
        have been regarded with quite as much respect as the saint whose
        memory it recalled. The freaks to which image-worship led were in
        some cases purely grotesque; it was, for example, not unusual to
        select a picture as the godfather of a child in baptism, and to
        scrape off a little of its paint and produce it at the ceremony to
        represent the saint. Even patriarchs and bishops ventured to assert
        that the hand of a celebrated representation of the Virgin distilled
        fragrant balsam. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page191">[pg
        191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The
        success of the Emperor Heraclius in his Persian campaign was ascribed
        by the vulgar not so much to his military talent as to the fact that
        he carried with him a small picture of the Virgin, which had fallen
        from heaven!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All these vain
        beliefs, inculcated by the clergy and eagerly believed by the mob,
        were repulsive to the educated laymen of the higher classes. Their
        dislike for vain superstitions was emphasized by the influence
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192"
        id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Mahometanism on their
        minds. For a hundred years the inhabitants of the Asiatic provinces
        of the empire had been in touch with a religion of which the noblest
        feature was its emphatic denunciation of idolatry under every shape
        and form. An East-Roman, when taunted by his Moslem neighbour for
        clinging to a faith which had grown corrupt and idolatrous, could not
        but confess that there was too much ground for the accusation, when
        he looked round on the daily practice of his countrymen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hence there had
        grown up among the stronger minds of the day a vigorous reaction
        against the prevailing superstitions. It was more visible among the
        laity than among the clergy, and far more widespread in Asia than in
        Europe. In Leo the Isaurian this tendency stood incarnate in its most
        militant form, and he left the legacy of his enthusiasm to his
        descendants. Seven years after the relief of Constantinople he
        commenced his crusade against superstition. The chief practices which
        he attacked were the worship of images and the ascription of divine
        honours to saints—more especially in the form of Mariolatry. His son
        Constantine, more bold and drastic than his father, endeavoured to
        suppress monasticism also, because he found the monks the most ardent
        defenders of images; but Leo's own measures went no further than a
        determined attempt to put down image-worship.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The struggle which
        he inaugurated began in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 725, when he ordered
        the removal of all the images in the capital. Rioting broke out at
        once, and the officials who were taking down the great figure of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193"
        id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Christ Crucified, over the
        palace-gate, were torn to pieces by a mob. The Emperor replied by a
        series of executions, and carried out his policy all over the empire
        by the aid of armed force.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The populace,
        headed by the monks, opposed a bitter resistance to the Emperor's
        doings, more especially in the European provinces. They set the
        wildest rumours afloat concerning his intentions; it was currently
        reported that the Jews had bought his consent to image-breaking, and
        that the Caliph Yezid had secretly converted him to Mahometanism.
        Though Leo's orthodoxy in matters doctrinal was unquestioned, and
        though he had no objection to the representation of the cross, as
        distinguished from the crucifix, he was accused of a design to
        undermine the foundations of Christianity. Arianism was the least
        offensive fault laid to his account. The Emperor's enemies did not
        confine themselves to passive resistance to his crusade against
        images. Dangerous revolts broke out in Greece and Italy, and were not
        put down without much fighting. In Italy, indeed, the imperial
        authority was shaken to its foundations, and never thoroughly
        re-established. The Popes consistently opposed the Iconoclastic
        movement, and by their denunciation of it placed themselves at the
        head of the anti-imperial party, nor did they shrink from allying
        themselves with the Lombards, who were now, as always, endeavouring
        to drive the East-Roman garrisons from Ravenna and Naples.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hatred which
        Leo provoked might have been fatal to him had he not possessed the
        full confidence of the army. But his great victory over the Saracens
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194"
        id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> had won him such popularity in
        the camp, that he was able to despise the wrath of the populace, and
        carry out his schemes to their end. Beside instituting ecclesiastical
        reforms he was a busy worker in all the various departments of the
        administration. He published a new code of laws, the first since
        Justinian, written in Greek instead of Latin, as the latter language
        was now quite extinct in the Balkan Peninsula. He reorganized the
        finances of the empire, which had fallen into hopeless confusion in
        the anarchy between 695 and 717. The army had much of his care, but
        it was more especially in the civil administration of the empire that
        he seems to have left his mark. From Leo's day the gradual process of
        decay which had been observable since the time of Justinian seems to
        come to an end, and for three hundred years the reorganized
        East-Roman state developed a power and energy which appear most
        surprising after the disasters of the unhappy seventh century. Having
        once lived down the Saracen danger, the empire reasserted its ancient
        mastery in the East, until the coming of the Turks in the eleventh
        century. We should be glad to have the details of Leo's reforms, but
        most unhappily the monkish chroniclers who described his reign have
        slurred over all his good deeds, in order to enlarge to more effect
        on the iniquities of his crusade against image-worship. The effects
        of his work are to be traced mainly by noting the improved and
        well-ordered state of the empire after his death, and comparing it
        with the anarchy that had preceded his accession.</p>

        leaving the throne to his son, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Constantine V., whom he had brought up to
        follow in his own footsteps. The new emperor was a good soldier and a
        capable man of business, but his main interest in life centred in the
        struggle against image-worship. Where Leo had chastised the adherents
        of superstition with whips Constantine chastised them with scorpions.
        He was a true persecutor, and executed not only rioters and traitors,
        as his father had done, but all prominent opponents of his policy who
        provoked his wrath. Hence he incurred an amount of hatred even
        greater than that which encompassed Leo III., and his very name has
        been handed down to history with the insulting byword <span lang="el"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Copronymus</span></span> tacked on to it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though strong and
        clever, Constantine was far below his father in ability, and his
        reign was marked by one or two disasters, though its general tenor
        was successful enough. Two defeats in Bulgaria were comparatively
        unimportant, but a noteworthy though not a dangerous loss was
        suffered when Ravenna and all the other East-Roman possessions in
        Central Italy were captured by the Lombards in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 750. At this time Pope
        Stephen, when attacked by the same enemy, sent for aid to Pipin the
        Frank, instead of calling on the Emperor, and for the future the
        papacy was for all practical purposes dependent on the Franks and not
        on the empire. The loss of the distant exarchate of Ravenna seemed a
        small thing, however, when placed by the side of Constantine's
        successes against the Saracens, Slavs, and Bulgarians, all of whom he
        beat back with great slaughter on the numerous occasions when they
        invaded the empire.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg
        197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in the minds
        both of Constantine himself and of his contemporaries, his dealings
        with things religious were the main feature of his reign. He
        collected a council of 338 bishops at Constantinople in 761, at which
        image-worship was declared contrary to all Christian doctrine, and
        after obtaining this condemnation, attacked it everywhere as a heresy
        and not merely a superstition. In the following year, finding the
        monks the strongest supporters of the images, he commenced a crusade
        against monasticism. He first forbade the reception of any novices,
        and shortly afterwards begun to close monasteries wholesale. We are
        told that he compelled many of their inmates to marry by force of
        threats; others were exiled to Cyprus by the hundred; not a few were
        flogged and imprisoned, and a certain number of prominent men were
        put to death. These unwise measures had the natural effect: the monks
        were everywhere regarded as martyrs, and the image-worship which they
        supported grew more than ever popular with the masses.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While still in the
        full vigour of his persecuting enthusiasm, Constantine Copronymus
        died in 775, leaving the throne to his son, Leo IV., an Iconoclast,
        like all his race, but one who imitated the milder measures of his
        grandfather rather than the more violent methods of his father. Leo
        was consumptive and died young, after a reign of little more than
        four years, in which nothing occurred of importance save a great
        victory over the Saracens in 776. His crown fell to his son,
        Constantine VI., a child of ten, while the Empress-Dowager Irene
        became sole regent, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg
        198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> her
        name was associated with that of her son in all acts of state.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Isaurian
        dynasty was destined to end in a fearful and unnatural tragedy. The
        Empress Irene was clever, domineering, and popular. The irresponsible
        power of her office of regent filled her with overweening ambition.
        She courted the favour of the populace and clergy by stopping the
        persecution of the image-worshippers, and filled all offices, civil
        and military, with creatures of her own. For ten years she ruled
        undisturbed, and grew so full of pride and self-confidence that she
        looked forward with dismay to the prospect of her son's attaining his
        majority and claiming his inheritance. Even when he had reached the
        age of manhood she kept him still excluded from state affairs, and
        compelled him to marry, against his will, a favourite of her own.
        Constantine was neither precocious nor unfilial, but in his
        twenty-second year he rebelled against his mother's dictation, and
        took his place at the helm of the state. Irene had actually striven
        to oppose him by armed force, but he pardoned her, and after
        secluding her for a short time, restored her to her former dignity.
        The unnatural mother was far from acquiescing in her son's elevation,
        and still dreamed of reasserting herself. She took advantage of the
        evil repute which Constantine won by a disastrous war with Bulgaria,
        and an unhappy quarrel with the Church, on the question of his
        divorce from the wife who had been forced upon him. More especially,
        however, she relied on her popularity with the multitude, which had
        been won by stopping the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg
        199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        persecution of the image-worshippers during her regency, for
        Constantine had resumed the policy of his ancestors and developed
        strong Iconoclastic tendencies when he came to his own.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 797 Irene
        imagined that things were ripe for attacking her son, and
        conspirators, acting by her orders, seized the young emperor, blinded
        him, and immured him in a monastery before any of his adherents were
        able to come to his aid. Thus ended the rule of the Isaurian dynasty.
        Constantine himself, however, survived many years as a blind monk,
        and lived to see the ends of no less than five of his successors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wicked Irene
        sat on her ill-gained throne for some five troublous years, much
        vexed by rebellion abroad and palace intrigues at home. It is
        astonishing that her reign lasted so long, but it would seem that her
        religious orthodoxy atoned in the eyes of many of her subjects for
        the monstrous crime of her usurpation. The end did not come till 802,
        when Nicephorus, her grand treasurer, having gained over some of the
        eunuchs and other courtiers about her person, quietly seized her and
        immured her in a monastery in the island of Chalke. No blow was
        struck by any one in the cause of the wicked empress, and Nicephorus
        quietly ascended the throne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though containing
        little that is memorable in itself, the reign of Irene must be noted
        as the severing-point of that connection between Rome and
        Constantinople, which had endured since the first days of empire. In
        the year 800 Pope Leo III. crowned Karl, King of the Franks, as Roman
        Emperor, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg
        200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        transferred to him the nominal allegiance which he had hitherto paid
        to Constantinople. Since the Italian rebellion in the time of
        Constantine Copronymus, that allegiance had been a mere shadow, and
        the papacy had been in reality under Frankish influence. But it was
        not till 800 that the final breach took place. The Iconoclastic
        controversy had prepared the way for it, while the fact that a woman
        sat on the imperial throne served as a good excuse for the Pope's
        action. Leo declared that a female reign was an anomaly and an
        abomination, and took upon himself the onus of ending it, so far as
        Italy was concerned, by creating a new emperor of the West. There
        was, of course, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg
        201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> no
        legality in the act, and Karl the Great was in no real sense the
        successor of Honorius and Romulus Augustulus, but he ruled a group of
        kingdoms which embraced the larger half of the old Western Empire,
        and formed a fair equipoise to the realm now ruled by Irene. From
        800, then, onward we have once more a West-Roman empire in existence
        as well as the East-Roman, and it will be convenient for many
        purposes to use the adjective Byzantine instead of the adjective
        Roman, when we are dealing with the remaining history of the realm
        that centred at Constantinople.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Iconoclastic
        controversy was far from being extinguished with the fall of the
        house of Leo the Isaurian. It was destined to continue in a milder
        form for more than half a century after the dethronement of
        Constantine VI. The lines on which it was fought out were still the
        same—the official hierarchy and the Asiatic provinces favoured
        Iconoclasm, the clergy and the European provinces were <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Iconodules.”</span><a id="noteref_22" name="noteref_22"
        href="#note_22"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> Hence it
        is interesting to note that through the greater part of the ninth
        century, while emperors of Eastern birth sat on the throne, the views
        of Leo the Isaurian were still in vogue, and that the eventual
        triumph of the image-worshippers only came about when a royal house
        sprung from one of the European themes—the family of Basil the
        Macedonian—gained possession of the crown.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The treasurer,
        Nicephorus, who overthrew Irene, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> and so easily obtained possession of the
        empire, was of Oriental extraction. His ancestor had been a Christian
        Arab prince, expelled from his country at the time of the rise of
        Mahomet, and his family had always dwelt in Asia Minor. Hence we are
        not surprised to find that Nicephorus was an Iconoclast, and refused
        to follow in the steps of Irene in the direction of restoring
        image-worship. He did not persecute the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Iconodules,”</span> as the Isaurians had done, but he
        gave them no personal encouragement. This being so, it is natural
        that we should find his character described in the blackest terms by
        the monkish chroniclers of the succeeding century. He was, we are
        told, a hypocrite, an oppresser, and a miser; but we cannot find any
        very distinct traces of the operation of such vices in his conduct
        during the nine years of his reign. He was not, however, a very
        fortunate ruler; though he put down with ease several insurrections
        of discontented generals, he was unlucky with his foreign wars. The
        Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid did much harm to the Asiatic provinces,
        ravaging the whole country as far as Ancyra, nor could Nicephorus get
        rid of him without signing a rather ignominious peace, and paying a
        large war-indemnity. A yet greater disaster concluded another war.
        Nicephorus invaded Bulgaria in 811, to punish King Crumn for ravaging
        Thrace. The Byzantine army won a battle and sacked the palace and
        capital of the Bulgarian king; but a few days later Nicephorus
        allowed himself to be surprised by a night attack on his camp. In the
        panic and confusion the emperor fell, and his son and heir,
        Stauracius, was desperately wounded. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> routed army did not stay its flight till
        Adrianople, and left the body of the Emperor in the hands of the
        Bulgarians, who cut off his head, and made the skull into a
        drinking-cup, just as the Lombards had dealt with the skull of King
        Cunimund three hundred years before.<a id="noteref_23" name=
        "noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stauracius, the
        only son of Nicephorus, was proclaimed emperor, but it soon became
        evident that his wound was mortal, and Michael Rhangabe, his
        brother-in-law, who had married the eldest daughter of Nicephorus,
        took his place on the throne before the breath was out of the dying
        emperor's body.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Michael I. was a
        weak, good-natured man, who owed his elevation to the mere chance of
        his marriage. He was a devoted servant and admirer of monks, and
        began to undo the work of his father-in-law, and remove all
        Iconoclasts from office. This provoked the wrath of that powerful
        party, and led to conspiracies against Michael, but he might have
        held his own if it had not been for the disgracefully incompetent way
        in which he conducted the Bulgarian war. He allowed an enemy whom the
        East-Romans had hitherto despised, not only to ravage the open
        country in Thrace, but to storm the fortresses of Mesembria and
        Anchialus, and to push their invasions up to the gates of
        Constantinople. The discontent of the army found vent in a mutiny,
        and Leo the Armenian, an officer of merit and capacity, was
        proclaimed emperor in the camp. Michael I. made no resistance, and
        retired into a monastery after only two years of reign. [811-13.]</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leo the Armenian
        proved himself worthy of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> confidence of the army. When the Bulgarians
        appeared in front of the walls of Constantinople they were repulsed,
        but Leo tarnished the glory of his success by a treacherous attempt
        to assassinate King Crumn at a conference—a crime as unnecessary as
        it was unsuccessful, for the Emperor might, as the event proved, have
        trusted to the sword instead of the dagger. In the next spring he
        took the offensive himself, marched out to Mesembria, and inflicted
        on the enemy such a sanguinary defeat that hardly a man escaped his
        sword, and Bulgaria was so weakened that it gave no further trouble
        for more than fifty years.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almost the moment
        that he was freed from the Bulgarian war, Leo became involved in the
        fatal Iconoclastic controversy. Being a native of an Oriental theme,
        he was naturally imbued with the views of his great namesake, the
        Isaurian, and inclined to reverse the policy of the monk-loving
        Michael I. But being moderate and wary he tried to introduce, without
        the use of force, a middle policy between image-breaking and
        image-worship—a fruitless attempt, which only brought him the
        nickname of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Chameleon.”</span> Leo's
        idea was the quaint device of permitting the use of images, but of
        hanging them so high from the ground that the public should not be
        able to touch or kiss them! This pleased nobody; on the one side, the
        patriarch and his monks inveighed against the moving of the images,
        while, on the other, tumultuous companies of Asiatic soldiery broke
        into churches and mutilated all the pictures and figures they could
        find. The seven years of Leo's reign were full of ecclesiastical
        bickerings, but it should be <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> remembered to his credit that no single person
        suffered death for his conscience' sake in the whole period. The most
        violent of the opponents of the Emperor were merely interned in
        remote monasteries, when they ventured to set their will against his.
        Long ere the end of his reign, Leo had been compelled to leave his
        half measures and prohibit all use of images. Like Constantine
        Copronymus, he called a council to endorse his action, and a majority
        of the Eastern bishops resolved that Iconolatry was a dangerous
        heresy, and anathematized the patriarch Nicephorus and all other
        defenders of the images.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leo's reign was
        prosperous in all save the matter of his religious troubles. But he
        was not destined to die in peace in his bed. Michael the Amorian, the
        best general in the empire, was detected in a conspiracy against his
        master. Leo cast him into prison, but delayed his punishment, and
        left his accomplices at large. Michael had many friends in the palace
        who determined to strike a blow ere the Emperor should have
        discovered their guilt. They resolved to slay Leo in his private
        chapel, as he attended matins on Christmas Day, for he was accustomed
        to come unarmed and unguarded to the early communion. Accordingly,
        the conspirators attended the service, and attacked the Emperor in
        the midst of the Eucharistic hymn. Leo snatched the heavy metal cross
        off the altar and struck down some of his assailants, but numbers
        were too many for him, and he was cut down and slain at the very foot
        of the holy table. [Christmas Day, 820.]</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Michael the
        Amorian was dragged out of his <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> dungeon, saluted as emperor, and crowned, even
        before the fetters were off his feet. It was not till the ceremony
        had been performed that time was found to send for a smith to strike
        away the rings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Michael was by
        birth a mere peasant, but had raised himself to high rank in the army
        by his courage and ability. He is sometimes styled <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the Amorian,”</span> from his birth-place, Amorium in
        Phrygia, but more often mentioned by his nickname of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the Stammerer.”</span> He had been the friend and
        adviser of Leo the Armenian at the time of the latter's elevation to
        the throne, and his conspiracy must be reckoned a gross piece of
        ingratitude, even though we acknowledge that he was not personally
        responsible for his master's murder.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though rough and
        uncultured, Michael was a man of very considerable ability. He
        strengthened his title to the crown by a marriage with the last scion
        of the Isaurian house, the princess Euphrosyne, daughter of the blind
        Constantine VI. The religious difficulties of the day he endeavoured
        to treat in an absolutely impartial way, so as to offend neither
        Iconoclasts nor Iconodules. He recalled from exile the
        image-worshipping monks whom Leo the Armenian had sent to distant
        monasteries, and proclaimed that for the future every subject of the
        empire should enjoy complete liberty of conscience on the disputed
        question. This was far from satisfying the image-worshippers, who
        wished Michael to restore their idols to their ancient places: but
        the Amorian would not consent to this, and obtained but a very
        qualified measure of approval from the monastic
        party.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg
        208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not to be
        expected that the reign of a military usurper, with no title to the
        throne whatever, would be untroubled by revolts. Michael had his
        share of such afflictions, and though he finally slew Thomas and
        Euphemius, the two pretenders who laid claim to his crown, yet by
        their means he lost two not inconsiderable provinces of his empire.
        While the rebellion of Thomas was in progress, an army of Saracens
        from Alexandria threw themselves on the island of Crete, and
        conquered it from end to end. When Michael's hands were free he sent
        two great armaments to expel the intruders, but both failed, and
        Crete was destined to remain for a whole century in Moslem hands. Its
        hundred harbours became the haunts of innumerable Corsairs, who grew
        to be the bane of commerce in the Levant, and were a serious danger
        to the empire whenever its fleet fell into bad hands and failed to
        keep the police of the seas.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A similar rising
        in Sicily under a rebel named Euphemius led to the invasion of that
        island by an army of Moors from Africa, who landed in 827, and
        maintained a foothold in spite of all efforts to expel them. At first
        their gains were not rapid, but in the time of Michael's successors
        they gradually won for themselves the whole of the island.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After nine years
        of reign the Amorian died a natural death, still wearing the crown he
        had won. It was just fifty years since any ruler of the empire had
        met such a peaceful end. He was succeeded by his son Theophilus, a
        vehement Iconoclast, whose persecuting tendencies had been with
        difficulty restrained in his father's life-time. His accession was
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209"
        id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the signal for a new campaign
        against image-worship; he induced the patriarch John the Grammarian,
        a strong Iconoclast like himself, to excommunicate as idolaters all
        who differed from him, and began to flog, banish, and imprison their
        leading men. His persecution would have been almost as vehement as
        that of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name=
        "Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Constantine
        Copronymus, but for the fact that he did not ever inflict the
        punishment of death; branding and mutilation however he did not
        disdain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Iconodules saw
        the vengeance of heaven for the misdeeds of Theophilus in the
        disasters which he suffered in war from the Saracens. He fell out
        with the Caliph Motassem, and in the first campaign took and burnt
        the town of Zapetra, for which the Commander of the Faithful had
        great regard.<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href=
        "#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a> This
        roused Motassem to furious wrath; he swore that he would destroy in
        revenge the town which Theophilus held most dear; he collected the
        largest Saracen army that had been seen since Moslemah beleaguered
        Constantinople in 717, and marched out of Tarsus with 130,000 men,
        each of whom (if legend speaks true) had the word Amorium painted on
        his shield. For it was Amorium, the birth-place of the Emperor, and
        the home of his ancestors that Motassem had sworn to sack. While one
        division of the Caliph's army defeated Theophilus, who had taken the
        field in person, another headed by Motassem himself marched straight
        on Amorium, and took it after a brave defence of fifty-five days.
        Thirty thousand of its inhabitants were massacred, and the town was
        burnt, but the Caliph then turned home satisfied with his revenge,
        and the empire suffered nothing more from this most dangerous
        invasion. The Saracen war dragged on in an indecisive way, but no
        further disaster was encountered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are other
        things to be recorded of Theophilus beside his persecution of
        image-worshippers and his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg
        211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> war
        with the Caliph. He was long remembered for his taste for gorgeous
        display; of all the East-Roman emperors he seems to have delighted
        the most in gold and silver work, gems and embroidery. His golden
        plane-tree was the talk of the East, and the golden lions at the foot
        of his throne, which rose and roared by the means of ingenious
        machinery within, were remembered for generations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor should the
        curious tale of his second marriage be left untold. When left a
        widower he bade the Empress-dowager Euphrosyne assemble at her levée
        all the most beautiful of the daughters of the East-Roman
        aristocracy, and came among them to choose a wife, carrying like
        Paris a golden apple in his hand. His glance was first fixed on the
        fair Eikasia, but approaching her he found no better topic to
        commence a conversation than the awkward statement that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“most of the evil had come into the world by means of
        women.”</span> The lady retorted that surely most of the good had
        also come into the world by their means, a reply which apparently
        discomposed Theophilus, for he walked on and without a further word
        gave the golden apple to Theodora, a rival beauty. The choice was
        hasty and unhappy, for Theodora was a devoted Iconodule, and used all
        her influence against her husband's religious opinions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Theophilus died in
        842, while still a young man, leaving the throne to his only son
        Michael, a child of three years, and the regency to the young
        empress. The moment that her husband's grave was closed Theodora set
        to work to undo his policy. Amid the applause of the monks and the
        populace of Constantinople <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg
        212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> she
        proclaimed the end of the persecution, sent for the banished
        image-worshippers from their places of exile, and deposed John the
        Grammarian, the Iconoclastic patriarch who had served Theophilus.
        Within thirty days of the commencement of the new reign the images
        had appeared once more on the walls of all the churches of
        Constantinople. The Iconoclasts seem to have been taken by surprise,
        and made no resistance to the revolution: however the empress did not
        take any measures to persecute them; it was only power and not
        security for life and limb that they lost. The sole permanent result
        of the long struggle which they had kept up was a curious compromise
        in the Eastern Church on the subject of representation of the human
        figure. Statues were never again erected in places of worship, but
        only paintings and mosaics. It was apparently believed that the
        actual image savoured too much of the heathen idol, but that no
        offence could possibly be given by the picture, which served as a
        pious remembrance of the holy personage it represented, but could be
        nothing more. Nevertheless the veneration of the Byzantines for their
        holy <span class="tei tei-q">“Eikons”</span> became almost as
        grotesque as idol-worship, and led to many quaint and curious forms
        of superstition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Theodora,
        engrossed in things religious, handed over the education of her young
        son to her brother Bardas, who became her co-regent and was
        afterwards made Caesar. He brought up the young Michael in the most
        reckless and unconscientious manner, teaching him his own vices of
        drunkenness and debauchery. Michael was an apt pupil, and ere he
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213"
        id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> reached the age of twenty-one
        had become a confirmed dipsomaniac. History knows him by the
        dishonourable nickname of <span class="tei tei-q">“Michael the
        Drunkard.”</span> Some years after his majority he grew discontented
        with his uncle, and slew him, in order that he might reign alone. His
        profligacy and intemperance became still more unbearable after Bardas
        was dead, and had it not been for the splendid organization of the
        Byzantine civil service the administration of the empire must have
        gone to pieces. Presently Michael grew tired of spending on state
        affairs any time that he could spare from his orgies, and appointed
        as Caesar and colleague his boon companion Basil the Macedonian.
        Basil had reached the position of grand chamberlain purely by the
        Emperor's favour; he rose from the lowest ranks and is said to have
        first entered Michael's service in the humble position of a groom.
        His practical ability, combined with a head hard enough to withstand
        the effect of even the longest debauch, won Michael's admiration, and
        so he came to be first chamberlain and then Caesar. Under the mask of
        a roisterer Basil concealed the most devouring ambition, and when he
        knew that his drunken benefactor had won the contempt of all the
        East-Roman world, had the impudence and ingratitude to plan his
        murder. Michael was stabbed while sleeping off the effects of one of
        his orgies, and his low-born colleague seized the palace and
        proclaimed himself emperor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It might have been
        expected that the East-Roman world would have refused to receive as
        its lord a man who owed his elevation to the freak of a drunkard,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214"
        id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and had then become the
        assassin of his benefactor. But strangely enough Basil was destined
        to found the longest dynasty that ever sat upon the
        Constantinopolitan throne. He turned out a far better ruler than
        might have been expected from his disgraceful antecedents, being one
        of those fortunate men who are able to utilize the work of others
        when their own powers and knowledge fall short.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Basil is mainly
        remembered for his codification of the laws of the empire, which
        superseded the <span lang="el" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "el"><span style="font-style: italic">Ecloga</span></span> of Leo the
        Isaurian, even as Leo's compilation had superseded the more solid and
        thorough work of Justinian. The <span lang="el" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="el"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Basilika</span></span> of Basil with the
        additions made by his son Leo VI. formed the code of the Byzantine
        Empire down to its last days, no further rearrangement being ever
        made.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Basil, being of
        European birth and not an Asiatic like the preceding emperors, was
        naturally an orthodox image-worshipper. He showed his bigotry by a
        fierce persecution of the Paulicians, an Asiatic sect of heretics
        accused of Manicheanism, whom the Iconoclast emperors had been wont
        to tolerate. Basil's oppression drove many of them over the Saracen
        frontier, where they took refuge with the Moslems and maintained
        themselves by plundering the borders of the empire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the other
        transactions of his nineteen years of reign [867-886], the only one
        deserving notice is the final loss of Sicily. The Saracens of Africa,
        who had held a footing in the island ever since the time of Michael
        II., now finished their work by storming Syracuse in 878.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The eighty years
        which followed the death of Basil the Macedonian were the most
        uneventful and monotonous in the whole history of the empire. They
        are entirely taken up by the two long reigns of Leo the Wise and
        Constantine Porphyrogenitus,<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25"

        and grandson of the founder of the dynasty. Basil had been a mere
        adventurer, an ignorant and uneducated but capable upstart. His
        successors—strange issue from such a stock—were a pair of mild,
        easy-going, and inoffensive men of literature. They wrote no annals
        with their sword, though the times were not unpropitious for military
        enterprise, but devoted themselves to the pen, and have left behind
        them some of the most useful and interesting works in Byzantine
        literature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the times had
        been harder it is doubtful whether <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Leo VI. and Constantine VII. would have been
        strong enough to protect their throne. But the period 880-960 was
        less troubled by foreign wars than any other corresponding period in
        the history of the East-Roman state. The empire of the Caliphs was
        breaking up in the East—the empire of Charles the Great had already
        broken up in the West—the Bulgarians and other neighbours of the
        realm on the north were being converted to Christianity, and settling
        down into quiet. The only troubles to which the East-Roman realm was
        exposed were piratical raids of the Russians on the north and the
        Saracens of Africa on the south. These were vexatious, but not
        dangerous. An active and warlike emperor would probably have found
        the time propitious for conquest from his neighbours, but Leo and
        Constantine were quiet, unenterprising men, who dwelt contentedly in
        the palace, and seldom or never took the field.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leo's reign of
        twenty-six years was only diversified by an unfortunate invasion of
        Bulgaria, which failed through the mismanagement of the generals, and
        for a great raid of Saracen pirates on Thessalonica in 904. The
        capture of the second city of the empire by a fleet of African
        adventurers was an incident disgraceful to the administration of Leo,
        and caused much outcry and sensation. But it is fair to say that it
        was taken almost by surprise, and stormed from the side of the sea
        where no attack had been expected. The armies and fleet of the empire
        would have availed to rescue the town if only its fall had been
        delayed a few weeks. When they had taken it the Saracens fled with
        their booty, and made no attempt to hold its walls.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Constantine
        Porphyrogenitus, the offspring of the fourth wife of Leo the Wise,
        and the child of his old age, was only seven when his heritage fell
        to him. For many years he was under the tutelage of guardians; first
        his father's brother Alexander ruled as his colleague, and became
        emperor-regent. Some years after Alexander had died an ambitious
        admiral named Romanus Lecapenus usurped the same position, declared
        himself emperor, and administered the realm. The life of Romanus was
        protracted into extreme old age, long after Constantine had reached
        his majority; but the ambitious veteran held tight to the sceptre,
        and kept the rightful heir in the background. Constantine consoled
        himself by writing books and painting pictures; it was not till he
        was nearly forty that he came to his own. Even then his success was
        not owing to his own energy; the sons of the aged Romanus had
        resolved to succeed their parent on the throne, in despite of the
        rights of Constantine. But when they declared themselves emperors and
        made their old father abdicate, an outburst of popular wrath was
        provoked. The mob and the guards joined to sweep away the
        presumptuous Stephen Lecapenus and his brother. They were immured in
        monasteries, and Constantine emerged from his seclusion to administer
        the empire for twenty years. He was somewhat weak and ineffective,
        but neither obstinate nor tyrannical; many abler men made worse
        rulers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief
        achievements of both Leo and Constantine were their books. Those of
        Leo consist of a manual on the Art of War, some theological
        treatises, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg
        218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        a book of prophecies, a collection of political enigmas, which were
        long the puzzle and admiration of the East.<a id="noteref_26" name=
        "noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> The
        first-named work is most valuable and interesting, bringing down the
        history of military organization, tactics, and strategy to Leo's own
        time, and giving us a perfect picture of the Byzantine army and its
        tactics, as well as incidental sketches of all the enemies with which
        it had to contend. The backbone of the force was still the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“themes”</span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“turmæ”</span> of heavy cavalry, of which every province
        had one. The number of the provinces had been much increased since
        the days of the emperors of the house of Heraclius, and this implied
        a corresponding increase in the troops. They were raised from
        subjects of the empire and officered by the Byzantine nobility, for
        as Leo observed, <span class="tei tei-q">“There was no difficulty in
        obtaining officers of good birth and private means, whose origin made
        them respected by the soldiery, while their money enabled them to win
        the good graces of their men by many gifts of small creature
        comforts, over and above their pay.”</span> The names of some of the
        great noble houses are found for generation after generation in the
        imperial muster rolls, such as those of Ducas, Phocas, Comnenus,
        Bryennius, Kerkuas, Diogenes, and many more. The pages of Leo's work
        breathe an entire confidence in the power of the army to deal with
        any foe; against Saracen, Turk, Hungarian, and Slav, instant and
        decisive action is advised; when caught, they should be fought and
        beaten. It <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg
        219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is
        only when dealing with the men of the West, the Franks and Lombards,
        that Leo recommends caution and deprecates any rash engagement in a
        general action, preferring to wear the enemy down by cutting off his
        supplies and harassing his marches. We gather a very favourable
        impression of the Byzantine army from Leo's book; it was organized,
        armed, and supplied in a manner that has no parallel till modern
        times. Each regiment possessed its special uniform, and was equipped
        with regularity. There was none of that variety in arms and
        organizations which was the bane of mediæval armies. The regiments
        had each attached to them an elaborate military train, a small body
        of engineers, and a provision of surgeons and ambulances. To
        encourage the saving of wounded men, Leo tells us that the bearer
        company was given a gold piece for every disabled soldier whom it
        brought off the field after a lost battle. It would be hard to find
        any similar care shown for the wounded till the days of our own
        century.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Byzantine
        fleet, as Leo describes it, had for its chief object the maintenance
        of the police of the seas in the Aegean, Levant, and South Italian
        waters. Its enemies were the Saracens of the Syrian and African
        coasts, and more especially the troublesome Corsairs of Crete, who
        were often beaten but never subdued till Nicephorus Phocas
        exterminated them in 961. The empire maintained three fleets, small
        ones in the Black Sea and in Western waters; but the largest in the
        Aegean. This was composed of sixty <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“dromonds,”</span> or war-vessels of the largest rating;
        their great depôt was in the arsenal at Constantinople, but they
        could <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name=
        "Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> also be refitted at
        Samos, Thessalonica, and several other ports. Owing to their superior
        size, and still more to their employment of the celebrated Greek
        fire, the imperial fleets generally had the better of the Saracen,
        but though they checked his larger squadrons, they could never
        suppress the petty piracy by isolated sea-robbers, which rendered all
        mediæval commerce so dangerous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The works of
        Constantine Porphyrogenitus are even more interesting than those of
        his father. His treatise called <span class="tei tei-q">“On the
        Themes”</span> is invaluable to the historian, as it gives a complete
        list of the Themes, their boundaries, inhabitants, characteristics,
        and resources, with some other incidental notices of value. Still
        more important is the book, <span class="tei tei-q">“On the
        Administration of the Empire,”</span> which contains directions for
        the foreign policy of the realm, and sketches the condition and
        resources of the various nations with whom the Constantinopolitan
        government had dealings. Constantine also wrote a biography of his
        grandfather, Basil the Macedonian, couched in terms of respect which
        that hardy usurper was far from deserving. But his longest and most
        ambitious work was on Court Ceremonies, a manual of etiquette and
        precedence, describing the official hierarchy of the empire, its
        duties and privileges, and containing elaborate directions for the
        conduct of state ceremonials and the interior economy of the royal
        household. On this comparatively trifling topic Constantine spent far
        more pains than on the works of larger interest which he composed.
        His books show him to have been a man of no great originative
        faculty, but <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg
        221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        gifted with the powers of a careful and methodical compiler, who
        loved details and never shirked trouble. His care for court pageants
        was very characteristic of the peaceful emperor, who had long been
        kept at home by his guardian, and forced to compensate himself by
        ceremonial for the want of real power.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact that two
        successive emperors devoted themselves to literary work is a
        sufficient sign that by the end of the ninth century the times of
        intellectual dearth and destitution which had so long prevailed were
        now at an end. From the death of Justinian to the end of the
        Heraclian dynasty matters grew gradually worse; from the rise of Leo
        the Isaurian onward they began slowly to improve. The darkest age in
        Byzantine literary history was from about 600 to 750, a period in
        which we have hardly any contemporary annalists, no poetry save the
        lost Heracliad of George of Pisidia, and very little even of
        theology. Literature seemed absolutely dead at the accession of the
        Isaurians, but the quickening influence of the reforms of the great
        Leo seems to have been felt in that province as in every other. By
        the end of the eighth century writers were far more numerous, though
        many of them were only anti-Iconoclastic controversialists, like
        Theodore Studita. By the ninth century we can trace the existence of
        a much larger literary class, and find a few really first-rate
        authors, such as the patriarch Photius (857-69), whose learning and
        width of culture was astonishing, and whose library-catalogue is the
        envy of modern scholars.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps the most
        interesting development of Byzantine literature were the epics, or
        Romances of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg
        222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Chivalry as we feel more inclined to call them, which were written
        toward the end of the times of the Macedonian dynasty. The epic of
        Digenes Akritas, a work of the end of the tenth century, celebrating
        the praises of a hero who lived in the reigns of Nicephorus Phocas
        and John Zimisces [963-80], may serve as a type of the class. It
        tells of the adventures in love and war of Basil Digenes Akritas,
        warden of the Cilician Marches, or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Clissurarch of Taurus,”</span> as his official title
        would have run. He was a mighty hunter, both of bears and of
        Saracens, put down the Apelates (or moss-troopers, to use a modern
        analogy) who infested the border, and led many a foray into Syria. He
        is even credited with the slaying of an occasional dragon by his
        admiring bard. But perhaps the most interesting episode is the story
        of his elopement with the fair Eudocia Ducas, daughter of the general
        of the Cappadocian theme, whom he carried off in despite of her
        father and seven brethren. Pursued by the irate family, he rode them
        down one by one at vantage points in the passes, but spared their
        lives, and was reconciled to them at the intercession of his bride.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Digenes Akritas”</span> is the best as well
        as the earliest of the class which it represents.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Art followed much
        the same course as literature in the period 600-900. It was in a
        state of decay for the first century and a half, and the surviving
        works of that time are often grotesquely rude. For sheer bad drawing
        and bad execution nothing can be worse than a coin of Constans II. or
        Constantine V.; a Frankish or Visigoth piece could not be much more
        unsightly. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg
        224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The
        few manuscripts which survive from that period display a
        corresponding, though not an equally great, decline in art. Mosaic
        work perhaps showed less decline than other branches of the
        decoration, but even here seventh and eighth century work is very
        rare.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the ninth
        century everything improves wonderfully. It is most astonishing to
        see how the old classical tradition of painting revive in the best
        manuscript illumination of the period; many of them might have been
        executed in the fifth or even the fourth century, so closely do they
        reproduce the old Roman style. It seems that the Iconoclastic
        controversy stimulated painting; persecuted by the emperors, the art
        of sacred portraiture became respected above all others by the
        multitude. Several of the most prominent <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Iconodule”</span> martyrs were painters, of whom it is
        recorded that their works were no less beautiful than edifying: those
        of Lazarus, whom the Emperor Theophilus tortured, are especially
        cited as triumphs of art as well as sanctity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though a
        persecutor of painters, Theophilus deserves a word of mention as the
        first great builder since Justinian, and as a patron of the minor
        arts of jewellery, silver work, and mosaic. There is good evidence
        that these were all in a very flourishing condition in his time.
        [829-42.]</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is one more
        point in the history of the empire in the ninth century to which
        attention must be called. This is the unique commercial importance of
        Constantinople during this and the two succeeding centuries. All
        other commerce than that of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> empire had been swept off the seas by the
        Saracen pirates in the preceding hundred years, and the only touch
        between Eastern and Western Christendom was kept up under the
        protection of the imperial navy. The Eastern products which found
        their way to Italy or France were all passed through the warehouses
        of the Bosphorus. It was East-Roman ships that carried all the trade;
        save a few Italian ports, such as Amalphi and the new city of Venice,
        no place seems even to have possessed merchant ships. This monopoly
        of the commerce of Europe was one of the greatest elements in the
        strength of the empire. So much money and goods passed through it
        that a rather harsh and unwise system of taxation did no permanent
        harm.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Constantine
        Porphyrogenitus had been dragging out the monotonous years of his
        long reign, events which completely changed the aspect of affairs in
        the Moslem East had been following each other in quick succession on
        the Asiatic frontier of his realm. Ever since it first came into
        existence the Byzantine Empire had been faced in Asia by a single
        powerful enemy; first by the Sassanian kingdom of Persia, then by the
        Caliphate under the two dynasties of the Ommeyades and the Abbasides.
        Now, however, the Caliphate had at last broken up, and the
        descendants of Abdallah-es-Saffah and Haroun-al-Raschid had become
        the vassals of a rebellious subject, and preserved a mere nominal
        sovereignty which did not extend beyond the walls of their palace in
        Bagdad.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The crisis had
        come in 951 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, when the armies of the
        Buhawid prince Imad-ud-din, who had seized on the sovereignty of
        Persia, broke into Bagdad and made the Caliph a prisoner in his own
        royal residence. For the future the Caliphs were no more <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> than puppets, and the Buhawid rulers used
        their names as a mere form and pretence. But the conquerors did not
        gain possession of the whole of the Caliphate; only Persia and the
        Lower Euphrates Valley obeyed them. Other dynasties rose and fought
        for the more western provinces of the old Moslem realm. The Emirs of
        Aleppo and Mosul, who ruled respectively in North Syria and in
        Mesopotamia, became the immediate neighbours of the East-Roman
        Empire, while the lands beyond them, Egypt and South Syria, formed
        the dominions of the house of the Ikshides.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
        Byzantines found on their eastern frontier no longer one great
        centralized power, but the comparatively weak Emirates of Aleppo and
        Mosul, with the Buhawid and Ikshidite kingdoms in their rear. The
        four Moslem states were all new and precarious creations of the
        sword, and were generally at war with each other. An unparalleled
        opportunity had arrived for the empire to take its revenge on its
        ancient enemies and to move back the Mahometan boundaries from the
        line along the Taurus where they had so long been fixed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fortunately it was
        not only the hour that had arrived, but also the man. The empire had
        at its disposal at this moment the best soldier that it had possessed
        since the death of Leo the Isaurian. Nicephorus Phocas was the head
        of one of those great landholding families of Asia Minor who formed
        the flower of the Byzantine aristocracy; he owned broad lands in
        Cappadocia, along the Mahometan frontier. His father and grandfather
        before him had been distinguished <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> officers, for the whole race lived by the
        sword, but Nicephorus far surpassed them. He was not only a practical
        soldier, but a military author: his book, Περὶ Παραδρόμης πολέμου,
        dealing with the organization of armies, still survives to testify to
        his capacity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was on
        Nicephorus then that Romanus II., the son and heir of Constantine
        VII., fixed his choice, when he resolved to commence an attack on the
        Mahometan powers. The point selected for assault was the island of
        Crete, the dangerous haunt of Corsairs which lay across the mouth of
        the Aegean, and sheltered the pestilent galleys that preyed on the
        trade of the empire with the West. Several expeditions against it had
        failed during the last half-century, but this one was fitted out on
        the largest scale. The vessels are said to have been numbered by the
        thousand, and the land force was chosen from the flower of the
        Asiatic <span class="tei tei-q">“themes.”</span> Complete success
        followed the arms of Nicephorus. He drove the Saracens into their
        chief town Chandax (Candia), stormed that city, and took an enormous
        booty—the hoarded wealth of a century of piracy. The whole island
        then submitted, and Nicephorus sailed back to Constantinople to
        present to his sovereign, in bonds, Kurup the captive Emir of Crete,
        and all the best of the booty of the island [961 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nicephorus was
        duly honoured for his feat of arms, and given command of an army
        destined to open a campaign in the next year against the great
        frontier strongholds of the Saracens in Asia Minor. Descending by the
        passes of the Central Taurus into <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Cilicia, Phocas stormed Anazarbus, and then
        forced Mount Amanus, and marched into Northern Syria. There he took
        the great town of Hierapolis, and laid siege to Aleppo, the capital
        of the Emir Seyf-ud-dowleh, who ruled from Mount Lebanon to the
        Euphrates. The Emir was routed, the walls of his capital were
        stormed, and Aleppo, with all its wealth, fell into the hands of the
        Byzantine general. But the citadel still held out, and its protracted
        resistance gave time for the Moslems of South Syria and Mesopotamia
        to combine for the relief of their northern compatriots. So great an
        army appeared before the walls of Aleppo that Phocas determined not
        to risk a battle, and retreated with his booty and his numerous
        prisoners into the defiles of Taurus [962 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>]. Sixty captured forts
        and castles in Cilicia and North Syria were the permanent fruits of
        his campaign.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next year the
        emperor Romanus II. died, very unexpectedly, ere he had reached his
        twenty-sixth year. He left a young wife, and two little boys, Basil,
        aged seven, and Constantine, who was only two. There followed the
        form of regency that custom had made usual. Nicephorus, the most
        powerful and popular subject of the empire, claimed the guardianship
        of the two young Caesars, and had himself crowned as their colleague.
        To secure his place he married their mother, the young and beautiful
        empress-dowager Theophano.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The joint reign of
        Nicephorus Phocas and his wards, Basil II. and Constantine VIII.
        lasted six years, 963-969. The regent behaved with scrupulous loyalty
        to the young princes, and made no attempt to <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> encroach on their rights, or to supplant them
        by any of his numerous nephews, who had looked forward to his
        accession as likely to lead to their own promotion to imperial
        power.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nicephorus was an
        indefatigable soldier, and spent more of his reign in the field than
        in the palace. His end in life was to complete, as emperor, the
        conquest of Cilicia and North Syria, which he had commenced as
        general. The years 964 and 965 were spent in achieving the former
        object: three long sieges made him master of the great Cilician
        frontier fortresses, Adana, Mopsuestia, and Tarsus. Their rich bronze
        gates were sent as trophies to Constantinople, and set up again in
        the archways of the imperial palace. A few months later the tale of
        victories was completed by the news that Cyprus also had fallen back
        into Byzantine hands, after having passed seventy-seven years in the
        power of the Saracens.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For two years
        after this Phocas was employed at home, where his administration was
        less popular than in the camp. The stern old soldier was not a friend
        of either priests or courtiers. He had several quarrels with the
        patriarch Polyeuctus, which made him detested by the clergy, and in
        his public life he displayed a dislike for pomp and ceremony which
        led the Byzantine populace to style him a niggard and an extortioner.
        He suppressed shows and sports, and turned all the public revenues
        into the war budget, which lay nearest his heart. When he left the
        city in 968 for a new campaign against the Saracens, he was a much
        less popular ruler than when he had entered it in triumph in 966
        after the conquest of Cilicia.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the camp,
        however, Nicephorus was as well loved and as successful as ever. His
        last Syrian expedition was no less glorious than his earlier campaign
        in the same quarter six years before. All the North Syrian cities
        fell into his hands—Emesa, Hierapolis, Laodicea, and with them
        Aleppo, the residence of the Emir: Damascus bought off the invader by
        a great tribute. Only Antioch, the ancient capital of the land, held
        out, and Antioch also was taken in the winter by escalade, through
        the daring of an officer named Burtzes. The story of its fall is
        curious. The Emperor had left a blockading army before it under a
        general named Peter, with orders not to risk an assault. Burtzes, the
        second in command, disobeyed orders and stormed a corner tower on a
        snowy night at the head of a small band of 300 men. Peter, in fear of
        the Emperor's orders, refused to send him aid, and for more than two
        days Burtzes maintained himself unaided in the tower he had won. At
        last, however, the main body entered, and the Saracens fled from the
        town. Nicephorus dismissed both his generals from the service—Burtzes
        for having acted against orders, Peter for having obeyed them too
        slavishly, and allowing an important advantage to be imperilled.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nicephorus
        returned to Constantinople in the following year, to meet his death
        at the hands of those who should have been his nearest and dearest.
        His wife, Theophano had learnt to hate her grim and stern husband,
        who, though he possessed all the virtues, displayed none of the
        graces. She had cast her eyes in love on the Emperor's favourite
        nephew, John Zimisces, a young cavalry officer, who had <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> greatly distinguished himself in the
        Syrian war. Zimisces listened to her tempting, but he was not swayed
        by lust, but by ambition: he had hoped that his uncle would make him
        heir to the throne, to the detriment of the young emperor Basil. The
        loyal old soldier had no idea of wronging his wards, and his nephew
        resolved to gain by murder what he could not gain by favour.</p>

        233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> one
        December night in 969. The Emperor was awakened from sleep to find a
        dozen of the assassins forcing his door. John threw him to the
        ground, and the others stabbed him, while he cried in his
        death-agony, <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, God! grant me Thy
        mercy!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus ended the
        brave and virtuous Nicephorus Phocas. His murderers succeeded in
        their end, for John Zimisces was able to seduce the guards, overawe
        the ministers, and force the patriarch to crown him emperor. He
        showed some contrition for the base slaughter of his uncle, giving
        away half his private fortune to found hospitals for lepers, and the
        other half to be distributed among the poor of the city. He did not
        wed the partner of his guilt, the empress Theophano, but refused to
        see her face, and ultimately sent her to a monastery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the manner of
        his accession could but be forgiven John might pass for a favourable
        specimen of an emperor. He respected the rights of the young emperors
        Basil and Constantine as scrupulously as his uncle had done, and
        proved that as an administrator and a soldier he was not unworthy to
        sit in the seat of Phocas. But the Nemesis of the murder of his uncle
        rested upon him in the shape of a long civil war. His cousin Bardas
        Phocas took arms to revenge the death of the old Nicephorus, and
        stirred up troubles among his Cappadocian countrymen for several
        years, till at last he was captured and immured in a monastery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief feat for
        which John Zimisces is remembered is his splendid victory over the
        Russians, whose great invasion of the Balkan Peninsula falls within
        the limits of his reign. We have not yet had much occasion
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234"
        id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to mention the Russian tribes,
        who for many centuries had been dwelling in obscurity and barbarism,
        by the waters of the Dnieper and the Duna, in a land of forest and
        marsh, far remote from the boundaries of the empire. Nor should we
        hear of them now, but for the fact that their scattered tribes had
        been of late unified into a single horde by a power from without, and
        urged forward into a career of conquest by a race of ambitious
        princes. Into the land of the Russians there had come some hundred
        years before the reign of John Zimisces [862 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>], a Viking band from
        Sweden, headed by Rurik, the ancestor of all the princes and Tzars of
        Russia. The descendants of these adventurers from the north had
        gradually conquered and subdued all the Slavonic tribes of the great
        forest-land, and formed them into a single powerful kingdom. Its
        capital lay at Kief on the Dnieper, and it had proved a formidable
        neighbour to all the barbarous tribes around. The Viking blood of the
        new Russian princes drove them seaward, and ere many generations had
        passed they had forced their way down the Dnieper into the Euxine,
        and begun to vex the northern borders of the Byzantine Empire with
        raids and ravages like those which the Danes inflicted on Western
        Europe. Twice already, within the tenth century, had large fleets of
        light Russia row-boats—they were copies on a smaller scale of the
        Viking ships of the North—stolen down from the Dnieper mouth to the
        shores of Thrace, and landed their plundering crews within a few
        miles of the Bosphorus, for a hurried raid on the rich suburban
        provinces. On the first occasion in 907, the Russians had returned
        home laden with plunder, but on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> second, which fell in 941, the Byzantine fleet
        had caught them at sea, and revenged the harrying of Thrace by
        sinking scores of their light boats, which could not resist for a
        moment the impact of the heavy war-galley urged by its hundred
        oars.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the attack
        which John Zimisces had to meet in 970 was far more formidable than
        either of those which had preceded it. Swiatoslaf, king of the
        Russians, had come down the Dnieper with no less than 60,000 men, and
        had thrown himself on to the kingdom of Bulgaria, which was at the
        moment distracted by civil war. He conquered the whole country, and
        soon his marauders were crossing the Balkans and showing themselves
        in the plain of Thrace. They even sacked the considerable town of
        Philippopolis before the imperial troops came to its aid. This roused
        Zimisces, who had been absent in Asia Minor, and in the early spring
        of 971 an imperial army of 30,000 men set out to cross the Balkans
        and drive the Russians into the Danube. The struggle which ensued was
        one of the most desperate which East-Roman history records. The
        Russians all fought on foot, in great square columns, armed with
        spear and axe: they wore mail shirts and peaked helmets, just like
        the Normans of Western Europe, to whom their princes were akin. The
        shock of their columns was terrible, and their constancy in standing
        firm almost incredible. Against these warriors of the North Zimisces
        led the mailed horsemen of the Asiatic themes, and the bowmen and
        slingers who were the flower of the Byzantine infantry. The tale of
        John's two great battles with the Russians at Presthlava and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237"
        id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Silistria reads much like the
        tale of the battle of Hastings. In Bulgaria, as in Sussex, the sturdy
        axeman long beat off the desperate cavalry charges of their
        opponents. But they could not resist the hail of arrows to which they
        had no missile weapons to oppose, and when once the archers had
        thinned their ranks, the Byzantine cavalry burst in, and made a
        fearful slaughter in the broken phalanx. More fortunate than Harold
        Godwineson at the field of Senlac, King Swiatoslaf escaped with his
        life and the relics of his army. But he was beleaguered within the
        walls of Silistria, and forced to yield himself, on the terms that he
        and his men might take their way homeward, on swearing never to
        molest the empire again. The Russian swore the oath and took a solemn
        farewell of Zimisces. The contrast between the two monarchs struck
        Leo the Deacon, a chronicler who seems to have been present at the
        scene, and caused him to describe the meeting with some vigour. We
        learn how the Emperor, a small alert fair-haired man, sat on his
        great war-horse by the river bank, in his golden armour with his
        guards about him, while the burly Viking rowed to meet him in a boat,
        clad in nothing but a white shirt, and with his long moustache
        floating in the wind. They bade each other adieu, and the Russian
        departed, only to fall in battle ere the year was out, at the hands
        of the Patzinak Tartars of the Southern Steppes. Soon after
        Swiatoslaf's death the majority of the Russians became Christians,
        and ere long ceased to trouble the empire by their raids. They became
        faithful adherents of the Eastern Church, and drew their learning,
        their civilization, even their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page239">[pg 239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class=

        are but Caesars misspelt, and the list of their names—Michael,
        Alexander, Nicholas, John, Peter, Alexis—sufficiently witnesses to
        their Byzantine godparents. Russian mercenaries were ere long
        enlisted in the imperial army, and formed the nucleus of the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Varangian guard,”</span> in which at a later
        day, Danes, English, and Norsemen of all sorts were incorporated.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 173%">XIX. The End Of The Macedonian
        Dynasty.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Basil II., who now
        sat in his own right on the throne which his warlike guardians
        Nicephorus and John had so long protected, was by no means unworthy
        to succeed them. Unlike his ancestors of the Macedonian house, he
        showed from the first a love for war and adventure. Probably the
        deeds of John and Nicephorus excited him to emulation: at any rate
        his long reign from 976 till 1025, is one continuous record of wars,
        and almost entirely of wars brought to a successful termination.
        Basil seemed to have modelled himself on the elder of his two
        guardians, the stern Nicephorus Phocas. His earliest years on the
        throne, indeed, were spent in the pursuit of pleasure, but ere he
        reached the age of thirty a sudden transformation was visible in him.
        He gave himself up entirely to war and religion: he took a vow of
        chastity, and always wore the garb of a monk under his armour and his
        imperial robes. His piety was exaggerated into bigotry and
        fanaticism, but it was undoubtedly real, though it did not keep him
        from the commission of many deeds of shocking cruelty <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the course of his wars. His justice
        was equally renowned, but it often degenerated into mere harshness
        and indifference to suffering. No one could have been more unlike his
        gay pleasure-loving father, or his mild literary grandfather, than
        the grim emperor who won from posterity the title of Bulgaroktonos,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the Slayer of the Bulgarians.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Basil's life-work
        was the moving back of the East-Roman border in the Balkan Peninsula
        as far as the Danube, a line which it had not touched since the
        Slavonic immigration in the days of Heraclius, three hundred and
        fifty years before. In the first years of his reign, indeed, he
        accomplished little, being much harassed by two rebellions of great
        Asiatic nobles—Bardas Phocas, the nephew of Nicephorus II., and
        Bardas Skleros, the general of the Armeniac theme. But after Phocas
        had died and Skleros had surrendered, Basil reserved all his energies
        for war in Europe, paying comparatively little attention to the
        Eastern conquests which had engrossed Nicephorus Phocas and John
        Zimisces.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The whole interior
        of the Balkan Peninsula formed at this period part of the dominions
        of Samuel King of the Bulgarians, who reigned over Bulgaria, Servia,
        inland Macedonia, and other districts around them. It was a strong
        and compact kingdom, administered by an able man, who had won his way
        to the throne by sheer strength and ability, for the old royal house
        had ceased out of the land during Swiatoslaf's invasion of Bulgaria
        ten years before. The main power of Samuel lay not in the land
        between Balkan and Danube, which gave his kingdom its name, but in
        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name=
        "Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Slavonic districts
        further West and South. The centre of his realm was the fortress of
        Ochrida, which he had chosen as his capital—a strong town situated on
        a lake among the Macedonian hills. There Samuel mustered his armies,
        and from thence he started forth to attach either Thessalonica or
        Adrianople, as the opportunity might come to him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The duel between
        Basil and Samuel lasted no less than thirty-four years, till the
        Bulgarian king died a beaten man in 1014. This long and unremitting
        struggle taxed all the energies of the empire, for Samuel was not a
        foe to be despised; he was no mere barbarian, but had learnt the art
        of war from his Byzantine neighbours, and had specially studied
        fortification. It was the desperate defences of his numerous
        hill-castles that made Basil's task such a long one. The details of
        the struggle are too long to follow out: suffice it to say that after
        some defeats in his earlier years, Basil accomplished the conquest of
        Bulgaria proper, as far as the Danube, in 1002, the year in which
        Widdin, the last of Samuel's strongholds in the North surrendered to
        him. For twelve years more the enemy held out in the Central Balkans,
        in his Macedonian strongholds, about Ochrida and Uskup. But at last,
        Basil's constant victories in the field, and his relentless slaughter
        of captives after the day was won, broke the force of the Bulgarian
        king. In 1014 the Emperor gained a crowning victory, after which he
        took 15,000 prisoners: he put out the eyes of all save one man in
        each hundred, and sent the poor wretches with their guides to seek
        King Samuel in his capital. The old Bulgarian was so overcome
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243"
        id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> at the horrible sight that he
        was seized with a fit, and died on the spot, of rage and grief. His
        successors Gabriel and Ladislas could make no head against the stern
        and relentless emperor, and in 1018 the last fortress of the kingdom
        of Ochrida surrendered at discretion. Contrary to his habit, Basil
        treated the vanquished foe with mildness, indulged in no massacres,
        and contented himself with repairing the old Roman roads and
        fortresses of the Central Balkans, without attempting to exterminate
        the Slavonic tribes that had so often defied him. His conquests
        rounded off the empire on its northern frontier, and made it touch
        the Magyar kingdom of Hungary, for Servia no less than Bulgaria and
        Macedonia formed part of his conquests. The Byzantine border now ran
        from Belgrade to the Danube mouth, a line which it was destined to
        preserve for nearly two hundred years, till the great rebellion of
        Bulgaria against Isaac Angelus in the year 1086.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having justly
        earned his grim title of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Slayer of the
        Bulgarians”</span> by his long series of victories in Europe, Basil
        turned in his old age to continue the work of John Zimisces on the
        Eastern frontier. There the Moslem states were still weak and
        divided; though a new power, the Fatimite dynasty in Egypt, had come
        to the front, and acquired an ascendency over its neighbours. Basil's
        last campaigns, in 1021-2, were directed against the princes of
        Armenia, and the Iberians and Abasgians who dwelt beyond them to the
        north. His arms were entirely successful, and he added many Armenian
        districts to his Eastern provinces; but it may be questioned whether
        these <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name=
        "Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> conquests were
        beneficial to the empire. A strong Armenian kingdom was a useful
        neighbour to the Byzantine realm; being a Christian state it was
        usually friendly to the empire, and acted as a barrier against Moslem
        attacks from Persia. Basil broke up the Armenian power, but did not
        annex the whole country, or establish in it any adequate provision
        against the ultimate danger of attacks from the East by the Mahometan
        powers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Basil died in 1025
        at the age of sixty-eight, just as he was preparing to send forth an
        expedition to rescue Sicily from the hands of the Saracens. He had
        won more provinces for the empire than any general since the days of
        the great Belisarius, and at his death the Byzantine borders had
        reached the furthest extension which they ever knew. His successors
        were to be unworthy of his throne, and were destined to lose
        provinces with as constant regularity as he himself had shown in
        gaining them. There was to be no one after him who could boast that
        he had fought thirty campaigns in the open field with harness on his
        back, and had never turned aside from any enterprise that he had ever
        taken in hand.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Basil's brother
        Constantine had been his colleague in name all through the half
        century of his reign. No one could have been more unlike the ascetic
        and indefatigable <span class="tei tei-q">“Slayer of the
        Bulgarians.”</span> Constantine was a mere worldling, a man of
        pleasure, a votary of the table and the wine cup, whose only
        redeeming tastes were a devotion to music and literature. He had
        dwelt in his corner of the palace surrounded by a little court of
        eunuchs and flatterers, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg
        245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        excluded by the stern Basil from all share and lot in the
        administration of the empire. Now Constantine found himself the heir
        of his childless brother, and was forced at the age of sixty to take
        up the responsibilities of empire. He proved an idle and incompetent,
        but not an actively mischievous sovereign. His worst act was to hand
        over the administration of the chief offices of state to six of his
        old courtiers—all eunuchs—whose elevation was a cause of wild anger
        to the great noble families, and whose inexperience led to much weak
        and futile government during his short reign.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Constantine died
        in 1028, after a very brief taste of empire. He was the last male of
        the Macedonian house, and left no heirs save his elderly unmarried
        daughters—whose education and moral training he had grossly
        neglected. Zoe, the eldest, was more than forty years of age, but her
        father had never found her a husband. On his death-bed, however, he
        sent for a middle-aged noble named Romanus Argyrus, and forced him,
        at an hour's notice, to wed the princess. Only two days later Romanus
        found himself left, by his father-in-law's death, titular head of the
        empire. But Zoe, a clever, obstinate, and unscrupulous woman, kept
        the reins of authority in her own hands, and gave her unwilling
        spouse many an evil hour. She was inordinately vain, and pretended,
        like Queen Elizabeth of England, to be the mistress of all hearts
        long after she was well advanced in middle age. Her husband let her
        go her own way, and devoted himself to such affairs of state as he
        was allowed to manage. His interference with warlike matters was most
        unhappy. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg
        246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Venturing a campaign in Syria, he led his army to defeat, and saw
        several towns on the border fall into the hands of the Emir of
        Aleppo. After a reign of six years Romanus died of a lingering
        disease, and Zoe was left a widow. Almost before the breath was out
        of her husband's body, the volatile empress—she was now over
        fifty—had chosen and wedded another partner. The new emperor was
        Michael the Paphlagonian, a young courtier who had been Gentleman of
        the Bedchamber to Romanus: he was twenty-eight years of age and noted
        as the most handsome man in Constantinople. His good looks had won
        Zoe's fancy, and to his own surprise he found himself seated on the
        throne by his elderly admirer [1034].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The object of
        Zoe's anile affection was a capable man, and justified his rather
        humiliating elevation by good service to the empire. He beat back the
        Saracens from Syria and put down a Bulgarian rebellion with success.
        But in his last years he saw Servia, one of the conquests of Basil
        II., burst out into revolt, and could not quell it. He also failed in
        a project to reconquer Sicily from the Moors, though he sent against
        the island George Maniakes, the best general of the day, who won many
        towns and defeated the Moslems in two pitched battles. The attempt to
        subdue the whole island failed, and the conquests of Maniakes were
        lost one after the other. Michael IV., though still a young man, was
        fearfully afflicted with epileptic fits, which sapped his health, and
        so enfeebled him that he died a hopeless invalid ere he reached the
        age of thirty-six. The irrepressible Zoe, now again a widow, took a
        few days to decide whether she would <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> adopt a son, or marry a third husband. She
        first tried the former alternative, and crowned as her colleague her
        late spouse's nephew and namesake Michael V. But the young man proved
        ungrateful, and strove to deprive the aged empress of the control of
        affairs. When he announced his intention of removing her from the
        capital, the city mob, who loved the Macedonian house, and laughed at
        rather than reprobated the foibles of Zoe, took arms to defend their
        mistress. In a fierce fight between the rioters and the guards of
        Michael V., 3,000 lives were lost: but the insurgents had the upper
        hand, routed the soldiery, and caught and blinded Michael.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Zoe, once more at
        the head of the state, now made her third marriage, at the age of
        sixty-two. She chose as her partner Constantine Monomachus, an old
        debauchee who had been her lover thirty years ago. Their joint reign
        was unhappy both at home and abroad. Frequent rebellions broke out
        both in Asia Minor and in the Balkan Peninsula. The Patzinaks sent
        forays across the Danube, while a new enemy, the Normans of South
        Italy, conquered the <span class="tei tei-q">“theme of
        Langobardia,”</span> the last Byzantine possession to the West of the
        Adriatic, and established in its stead the duchy of Apulia [1055]. A
        still more dangerous foe began also to be heard of along the Eastern
        frontier. The Seljouk Turks were now commencing a career of conquest
        in Persia and the lands on the Oxus. In 1048 the advance guard of
        their hordes began to ravage the Armenian frontier of the empire. But
        this danger was not yet a pressing one.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Zoe and
        Constantine IX. were dead, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> sole remaining scion of the Macedonian house
        was saluted as ruler of the empire. This was Theodora, the younger
        sister of Zoe, an old woman of seventy, who had spent the best part
        of her days in a nunnery. She was as sour and ascetic as her sister
        had been vain and amorous; but she does not seem to have been the
        worst of the rulers of Byzantium, and her two years of power were not
        troubled by rebellions or vexed by foreign war. Her austere virtues
        won her some respect from the people, and the fact that she was the
        last of her house, and that with its extinction the troubles of a
        disputed succession were doomed to come upon the empire, seems to
        have sobered her subjects, and led them to let the last days of the
        Basilian dynasty pass away in peace.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Theodora died on
        the 30th of August, 1057, having on her death-bed declared that she
        adopted Michael Stratioticus as her successor. Then commenced the
        reign of trouble, the <span class="tei tei-q">“third anarchy”</span>
        in the history of the Byzantine Empire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The moment that
        the last of the Macedonian dynasty was gone, the elements of discord
        seemed unchained, and the double scourge of civil war and foreign
        invasion began to afflict the empire. In the twenty-four years
        between 1057 and 1081 were pressed more disasters than had been seen
        in any other period of East-Roman history, save perhaps the reign of
        Heraclius. For now came the second cutting-short of the empire, the
        blow that was destined to shear away half its strength, and leave it
        maimed beyond any possibility of ultimate recovery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Domestic troubles
        were the first inevitable consequence of the extinction of the
        Macedonian dynasty. The aged Theodora had named as her successor on
        the throne Michael Stratioticus, a contemporary of her own who had
        been an able soldier twenty-five years back. But Michael VI. was
        grown aged and incompetent, and the empire was full of ambitious
        generals, who would not tolerate a dotard on the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> throne. Before a year had passed a band
        of great Asiatic nobles entered into a conspiracy to overturn
        Michael, and replace him by Isaac Comnenus, the chief of one of the
        ancient Cappadocian houses, and the most popular general of the
        East.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Isaac Comnenus and
        his friends took arms, and dispossessed the aged Michael of his
        throne with little difficulty. But a curse seemed to rest upon the
        usurpation; Isaac was stricken down by disease when he had been
        little more than a year on the throne, and retired to a monastery to
        die. His crown was transferred to Constantine Ducas, another
        Cappadocian noble, who was supposed to be second only to Isaac in
        competence and popularity. Constantine reigned for seven troubled
        years, and disappointed all his supporters, for he proved but a sorry
        administrator. His mind was set on nothing but finance, and in the
        endeavour to build up again the imperial treasure, which had been
        sorely wasted since the death of Basil II., he neglected all the
        other departments of state. To save money he disbanded no
        inconsiderable portion of the army, and cut down the pay of the rest.
        This was sheer madness, when there was impending over the empire the
        most terrible military danger that had been seen for four centuries.
        The safety of the realm was entirely in the hands of its well-paid
        and well-disciplined national army, and anything that impaired the
        efficiency of the army was fraught with the deadliest peril.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Seljouk Turks
        were now drawing near. Pressing on from the Oxus lands, their hordes
        had overrun Persia and extinguished the dynasty of the Buhawides.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251"
        id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> In 1050, they had penetrated
        to Bagdad, and their great chief, Togrul Beg, had declared himself
        <span class="tei tei-q">“defender of the faith and protector of the
        Caliph.”</span> Armenia had next been overrun, and those portions of
        it which had not been annexed to the empire, and still obeyed
        independent princes, had been conquered by 1064. In that year fell
        Ani, the ancient Armenian capital, and the bulwark which protected
        the Byzantine Empire from Eastern invasions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reign of
        Constantine Ducas was troubled by countless Seljouk invasions of the
        Armeniac, Anatolic, and Cappadocian themes. Sometimes the invaders
        were driven back, sometimes they eluded the imperial troops and
        escaped with their booty. But whether successful or unsuccessful,
        they displayed a reckless cruelty, far surpassing anything that the
        Saracens had ever shown. Wherever they passed they not merely
        plundered to right and left, but slew off the whole population.
        Meanwhile, Constantine X., with his reduced army, proved incompetent
        to hold them back; all the more so that his operations were
        distracted by an invasion of the Uzes, a Tartar tribe from the Euxine
        shore, who had burst into Bulgaria.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ducas died in
        1067, leaving the throne to his son, Michael, a boy of fourteen
        years. The usual result followed. To secure her son's life and
        throne, the Empress-dowager Eudocia took a new husband, and made him
        guardian of the young Michael. The new Emperor-regent was Romanus
        Diogenes, an Asiatic noble, whose brilliant courage displayed in the
        Seljouk wars had dazzled the world, and caused it to forget that
        caution and ability are far more regal virtues than <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252" id="Pg252"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> headlong valour. Romanus took in hand
        with the greatest vigour the task of repelling the Turks, which his
        predecessor had so grievously neglected. He led into the field every
        man that could be collected from the European or Asiatic themes, and
        for three successive years was incessantly marching and
        counter-marching in Armenia, Cappadocia, and Syria, in the endeavour
        to hunt down the marauding bands of the Seljouks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The operations of
        Romanus were not entirely unsuccessful. Alp Arslan, the Sultan of the
        Seljouks, contented himself at first with dispersing his hordes in
        scattered bands, and attacking many points of the frontier at once.
        Hence the Emperor was not unfrequently able to catch and slay off one
        of the minor divisions of the Turkish army. But some of them always
        contrived to elude him; his heavy cavalry could not come up with the
        light Seljouk horse bowmen, who generally escaped and rode back home
        by a long detour, burning and murdering as they went. Cappadocia was
        already desolated from end to end, and the Turkish raids had reached
        as far as Amorium, in Phrygia.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1071 came the
        final disaster. In pursuing the Seljouk plunderers, Romanus was drawn
        far eastward, to Manzikert, on the Armenian frontier. There he found
        himself confronted, not by a flying foe, but by the whole force of
        the Seljouk sultanate, with Alp Arslan himself at its head. Though
        his army was harassed by long marches, and though two large divisions
        were absent, the Emperor was eager to fight. The Turks had never
        before offered him a fair field, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> and he relied implicitly on the power of his
        cuirassiers to ride down any number, however great, of the light
        Turkish horse.</p>

        battle of Manzikert, which it is not too much to call the
        turning-point of the whole course of Byzantine history, was fought in
        the early summer of 1071. For a long day the Byzantine horsemen
        continued to roll back and break through the lines of Turkish horse
        bowmen. But fresh hordes kept coming on, and in the evening the fight
        was still undecided. As the night was approaching, Romanus prepared
        to draw his troops back to the camp, but an unhappy misconception of
        orders broke up the line, and the Seljouks edged in between the two
        halves of the army. Either from treachery or cowardice Andronicus
        Ducas, the officer who commanded the reserve, led his men off without
        fighting. The Emperor's division was beset on all sides by the enemy,
        and broke up in the dusk. Romanus himself was wounded, thrown from
        his horse, and made prisoner. The greater part of his men were cut to
        pieces.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alp Arslan showed
        himself more forbearing to his prisoner than might have been
        expected. It is true that Romanus was led after his capture to the
        tent of the Sultan, and laid prostrate before him, that, after the
        Turkish custom, the conqueror might place his foot on the neck of his
        vanquished foe. But after this humiliating ceremony the Emperor was
        treated with kindness, and allowed after some months to ransom
        himself and return home. He would have fared better, however, if he
        had remained the prisoner of the Turk. During his captivity the
        conduct of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg
        255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        affairs had fallen into the hands of John Ducas, uncle of the young
        emperor Michael. The unscrupulous regent was determined that Romanus
        should not supersede him and mount the throne again. When the
        released captive reappeared, John had him seized <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and blinded. The cruel work was so
        roughly done that the unfortunate Romanus died a few days later.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this fearful
        disaster Asia Minor was lost; there was no chief to take the place of
        Romanus, and the Seljouk hordes spread westward almost unopposed. The
        next ten years were a time of chaos and disaster. While the Seljouks
        were carving their way deeper and deeper into the vitals of the
        empire, the wrecks of the Byzantine army were employed not in
        resisting them, but in carrying on a desperate series of civil wars.
        After the death of Romanus, every general in the empire seemed to
        think that the time had come for him to assume the purple buskins and
        proclaim himself emperor. History records the names of no less than
        six pretenders to the throne during the next nine years, besides
        several rebels who took up arms without assuming the imperial title.
        The young emperor, Michael Ducas, proved, when he came of age, to be
        a vicious nonentity; he is remembered in Byzantine history only by
        his nickname of Para-pinakes, the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“peck-filcher,”</span> given him because in a year of
        famine he sold the measure of wheat to his subjects a fourth short of
        its proper contents. His name and that of Nicephorus Botaniates, the
        rebel who overthrew him, cover in the list of emperors a space of ten
        years that would better be represented by a blank; for the authority
        of the nominal ruler scarcely extended beyond the walls of the
        capital, and the themes that were not overrun by the Turks were in
        the hands of governors who each did what was right in his own eyes.
        At last a man of ability worked himself up to the surface. This was
        Alexius <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a name=
        "Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Comnenus, nephew of
        the emperor Isaac Comnenus, whose short reign we related in the
        opening paragraph of this chapter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alexius was a man
        of courage and ability, but he displayed one of the worst types of
        Byzantine character. Indeed, he was the first emperor to whom the
        epithet <span class="tei tei-q">“Byzantine,”</span> in its common and
        opprobrious sense could be applied. He was the most accomplished liar
        of his age, and, while winning and defending the imperial throne,
        committed enough acts of mean treachery, and swore enough false oaths
        to startle even the courtiers of Constantinople. He could fight when
        necessary, but he preferred to win by treason and perjury. Yet as a
        ruler he had many virtues, and it will always be remembered to his
        credit that he dragged the empire out of the deepest slough of
        degradation and ruin that it had ever sunk into. Though false, he was
        not cruel, and seven ex-emperors and usurpers, living unharmed in
        Constantinople under his sceptre, bore witness to the mildness of his
        rule. The tale of his reign sufficiently bears witness to the strange
        mixture of moral obliquity and practical ability in his
        character.</p>

        Crusades.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alexius Comnenus
        found himself, in 1081, placed in a position almost as difficult and
        perilous as that which Leo the Isaurian faced in 716. Like Leo, he
        was a usurper without prestige or hereditary claims, seated on an
        unsteady throne, and forced to face imminent danger from the Moslem
        enemy without, and from rival adventurers within. It may be added
        that the Isaurian, grievously threatened as he was by the enemy from
        the East, had no peril impending from the West. Alexius had to face
        at one and the same time the assault of the Seljouks on Asia Minor,
        and the attack of a new and formidable foe in his western provinces.
        We have already mentioned the manner in which the Byzantine dominion
        in Italy had come to an end. Now the same Norman adventurers who had
        stripped the empire of Calabria and Apulia were preparing to cross
        the straits of Otranto, and seek out the Emperor in the central
        provinces of his realm. The forces of the Italian and Sicilian
        Normans were united under <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg
        259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        their great chief Robert Guiscard, the hardy and unscrupulous Duke of
        Apulia. Just ten years before he had captured Bari, the last
        Byzantine fortress on his own side of the straits; now he was
        resolved to take advantage of the anarchy which had prevailed in the
        empire ever since the day of Manzikert, and to build up new Norman
        principalities to the east of the Adriatic. There seemed to be
        nothing presumptuous in the scheme to those who remembered how a few
        hundred Norman adventurers had conquered all Southern Italy and
        Sicily, and swelled into a victorious army fifty thousand strong. Nor
        could the invaders fail to remember how, but fifteen years before,
        another Norman duke had crossed another strait in the far West, and
        won by his strong right hand the great kingdom of England. Alexius
        Comnenus sat like Harold Godwinson on a lately-acquired and unsteady
        throne, and Duke Robert thought to deal with him much as Duke William
        had dealt with the Englishman.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In June, 1081, the
        Normans landed, thirty thousand strong, and laid siege to Durazzo,
        the maritime fortress that guarded the Epirot coast. The Emperor at
        once flew to its succour. Always active, hopeful, and versatile, he
        trusted that he might be able to beat off the new invaders, whose
        military worth he was far from appreciating at its true value. He
        patched up a hasty pacification with Suleiman, Sultan of the
        Seljouks, by surrendering to him all the territory of which the Turk
        was in actual possession, a tract which now extended as far as the
        waters of the Propontis, and actually included the city of Nicaea,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260"
        id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> close to the Bithynian shore,
        and only seventy miles from Constantinople.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The army with
        which Alexius had to face the Normans was the mere wreck and shadow
        of that which Romanus IV. had led against the Turks ten years before.
        The military organization of the empire had gone to pieces, and we no
        longer hear of the old <span class="tei tei-q">“Themes”</span> of
        heavy cavalry which had formed its backbone. The new army contained
        quite a small proportion of national troops. Its core was the
        imperial guard of Varangians—the Russian, Danish, and English
        mercenaries, whose courage had won the confidence of so many
        emperors. With them marched many Turkish, Frankish, Servian, and
        South-Slavonic auxiliaries; the native element comprised the regulars
        of the three provinces of Thrace, Macedonia, and Thessaly, all that
        now remained in Alexius' hands of the ancient East-Roman realm.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alexius brought
        Robert Guiscard to battle in front of Durazzo, and suffered a
        crushing defeat at his hands. The Emperor's bad tactics were the main
        cause of his failure: his army came upon the ground in successive
        detachments, and the van was cut to pieces before the main body had
        reached the field. The brunt of the battle was borne by the
        Varangians: carried away by their fiery courage, they charged the
        Normans before the rest of Alexius's troops had formed their line of
        battle. Rushing on the wing of Robert's army, commanded by the Count
        of Bari, they drove it horse and foot into the sea. Their success,
        however, disordered their ranks, and the Norman duke was able to turn
        his whole force <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg
        261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        against them ere the Emperor was near enough to give them aid. A
        fierce cavalry charge cut off the greater part of the Varangians; the
        rest collected on a mound by the sea-shore, and for some time beat
        off the Normans with their axes, as King Harold's men had done at
        Senlac on the last occasion when English and Norman had met. But
        Robert shot them down with his archers, and then sent more cavalry
        against them. They fell, save a small remnant who defended themselves
        in a ruined chapel, which Guiscard had finally to burn before he
        could make an end of its obstinate defenders.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rest of
        Alexius's army only came into action when the Varangians had been
        destroyed. It was cowed by the loss of its best corps, fought badly,
        and fled in haste. Alexius himself, who lingered last upon the field,
        was surrounded, and only escaped by the speed of his horse and the
        strength of his sword-arm. Durazzo fell, and in the next year the
        Normans overran all Epirus and descended into Thessaly. Alexius
        risked two more engagements with them, but his inexperienced troops
        were defeated in both. Disaster taught him to avoid pitched battles,
        and at last, in 1083, after a more cautious campaign, his patience
        was rewarded by the dispersion of the Norman army. Catching it while
        divided, the Emperor inflicted on it a severe defeat at Larissa, and
        forced it back into Epirus. After this the war slackened, and when
        Robert Guiscard died in 1085 the Norman danger passed away.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus one foe was
        removed, but Alexius was not destined to win peace. Constant
        rebellions at home, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg
        262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        wars with the Patzinaks, the Slavs, and the Seljouks filled the next
        ten years. Alexius, however, was never discouraged: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“eking out the lion's skin with the fox's hide,”</span>
        he fought and intrigued, lied and negotiated, and at the end of the
        time had held his own and lost no more territory, while his throne
        was growing more secure.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in the
        fifteenth year of his reign a new cloud began to arise in the west,
        which was destined to exercise unsuspected influence, both for good
        and evil, on the empire. The Crusades were on the eve of their
        commencement. Ever since the Seljouks had taken Jerusalem in 1075,
        four years after Manzikert, the western pilgrims to the Holy Land had
        been suffering grievous things at the hands of the barbarians. But
        all the wrath that their ill-treatment provoked would have been
        fruitless, if the way to Syria had not been opened of late to the
        nations of Western Christendom. Two series of events had made free
        communication between East and West possible in the end of the
        eleventh century, in a measure which had never before been seen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first of these
        was the conversion of Hungary, begun by St. Stephen in 1000, and
        completed about 1050. For the future there lay between the Byzantine
        Empire and Germany not a barbarous pagan state, but a semi-civilized
        Christian kingdom, which had taken its place among the other nations
        of the Roman Catholic faith. Communication down the Danube, between
        Vienna and the Byzantine outposts in Bulgaria, became for the first
        time possible, and ere long the route grew popular. The second
        phenomenon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg
        263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        which made the Crusades possible was the destruction of the Saracen
        naval power in the Central Mediterranean. This was carried out first
        by the Pisans and Genoese, whose fleets conquered Corsica and
        Sardinia from the Moslems, and then by the Normans, whose occupation
        of Sicily made the voyage from Marseilles and Genoa to the East safe
        and sure. Four new maritime powers—the Genoese, Pisans, and Normans
        in the open sea, and the Venetians in the Adriatic—had developed
        themselves into importance, and now their fleets swept the waters
        where no Christian war-galleys save those of Byzantium, had ever been
        seen before.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the fact
        that free access to the East was now to be gained, both by land and
        sea, as it had never been before, that made the Crusades feasible. Of
        the preaching of Peter the Hermit and the efforts of Pope Urban we
        need not speak. Suffice it to say, that in 1095 news came to the
        Emperor Alexius that the nations of the West were mustering by
        myriads, and directing their march towards his frontiers, with the
        expressed intention of driving the Moslems from Palestine. The
        Emperor had little confidence in the purity of the zeal of the
        Crusaders; his wily mind could not comprehend their enthusiasm, and
        he dreaded that some unforeseen circumstance might turn their arms
        against himself. When the hordes of armed Frankish pilgrims began to
        arrive, his fears were justified: the new-comers pillaged his country
        right and left upon their way, and were drawn into many bloody fights
        with the peasantry and the imperial garrisons, which might have ended
        in open <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name=
        "Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> war. But Alexius set
        himself to work to smooth matters down; all his tact and patience
        were needed, and there was ample scope for his talent for intrigue
        and insincere diplomacy. He had resolved to induce the crusading
        chiefs to do him homage, and to swear to restore to him all the old
        dominions of the empire which they might reconquer from the Turks.
        After long and tedious negotiations he had his way: the leaders of
        the Crusade, from Godfrey of Bouillon and Hugh of Vermandois down to
        the smallest barons, were induced to swear him allegiance. Some he
        flattered, others he bribed, others he strove to frighten into
        compliance. The pages of the history written by his daughter, Anna
        Comnena, who regarded his powers of cajolery with greater respect
        than any other part of his character, are full of tales of the
        ingenious shifts by which he brought the stupid and arrogant Franks
        to reason. At length they went on their way, with Alexius's gold in
        their pockets, and encouraged by his promise that he would aid them
        with his troops, continue to supply them with provisions, and never
        abandon them till the Holy City was reconquered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the spring of
        1097 the Crusaders began to cross the Bosphorus, and in two marches
        found themselves within Turkish territory. They at once laid siege to
        Nicaea, the frontier fortress of the Seljouk Sultan. Encompassed by
        so great a host the Turkish garrison soon lost heart and surrendered,
        not to the Franks, but to Alexius, whose troops they secretly
        admitted within the walls. This nearly led to strife between the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1097 the
        Crusaders forced their way through Phrygia and Cappadocia, beating
        back the Seljouks at every encounter, till they reached North Syria,
        where they laid siege to Antioch. Alexius had undertaken to help them
        in their campaign, but he was set on playing an easier game. When
        they were crushing the Turks he followed in their rear at a safe
        distance, like the jackal behind the lion, picking up the spoil which
        they left. While the Sultan was engaged with them Alexius despoiled
        him of Smyrna, Ephesus, and Sardis, reconquering Western Asia Minor
        almost without a blow, since the Seljouk hordes were drawn away
        eastward. It was the same in the next year; when the Crusaders were
        fighting hard round Antioch against the princes of Mesopotamia, and
        sent to ask for instant help, Alexius despatched no troops to Syria,
        but gathered in a number of Lydian and Phrygian fortresses which lay
        nearer to his hand. Hence there resulted a bitter quarrel between the
        Emperor and the Franks, for since he gave them no help they refused
        to hand over to him Antioch and their other Syrian conquests. Each
        party, in fact, broke the compact signed at Constantinople, and
        accused the other of treachery. Hence it resulted that the Crusade
        ended not in the re-establishment of the Byzantine power in Syria,
        but in the foundation of new Frankish states, the principalities of
        Edessa, Antioch, and Tripoli, and the more important kingdom of
        Jerusalem.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg
        267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That he did not
        recover Syria was no real loss to Alexius; he would not have been
        strong enough to hold it, had it been handed over to him. The actual
        profit which he made by the Crusade was enough to content him: the
        Franks had rolled back the Turkish frontier in Asia not less than two
        hundred miles: instead of the Seljouk lying at Nicaea, he was now
        chased back behind the Bithynian hills, and the empire had recovered
        all Lydia and Caria with much of the Phrygian inland. The Seljouks
        were hard hit, and for well-nigh a century were reduced to fight on
        the defensive.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Owing, then, to
        the fearful blow inflicted by the Crusades on the Moslem powers of
        Asia Minor and Syria, the later years of Alexius were free from the
        danger which had overshadowed the beginning of his reign. He was
        able, between 1100 and 1118, to strengthen his position at home and
        abroad; the constant rebellions which had vexed his early years
        ceased, and when the Normans, under Bohemund of Tarentum, tried to
        repeat, in 1107, the feats which Robert Guiscard had accomplished in
        1082, they were beaten off with ease, and forced to conclude a
        disadvantageous peace.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reign of
        Alexius might have been counted a period of success and prosperity if
        it had not been for two considerations. The first was the rapid
        decline of Constantinople as a commercial centre, which was brought
        about by the Crusades. When the Genoese and Venetians succeeded in
        establishing themselves in the seaports of Syria, they began to visit
        Constantinople far less than before. It paid them much <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> better to conduct their business at Acre
        or Tyre than on the Bosphorus. The king of Jerusalem, the weakest of
        feudal sovereigns, could be more easily bullied and defrauded than
        the powerful ruler of Constantinople. In his own seaports he
        possessed hardly a shadow of authority: the Italians traded there on
        such conditions as they chose. Hence the commerce of the West with
        Persia, Egypt, Syria, and India, ceased to pass through the
        Bosphorus. Genoa and Venice became the marts at which France, Italy,
        and Germany, sought their Eastern goods. It is probable that the
        trade of Constantinople fell off by a third or even a half in the
        fifty years that followed the first Crusade. The effect of this
        decline on the coffers of the state was deplorable, for it was
        ultimately on its commercial wealth that the Byzantine state based
        its prosperity. All through the reigns of Alexius and his two
        successors the complaints about the rapid fall in the imperial
        revenue grew more and more noticeable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This dangerous
        decay in the finances of the empire was rendered still more fatal by
        the political devices of Alexius, who began to bestow excessive
        commercial privileges to the Italian republics, in return for their
        aid in war. This system commenced in 1081, when the Emperor, then in
        the full stress of his first Norman war, granted the Venetians the
        free access to most of the ports of his empire without the payment of
        any customs dues. To give to foreigners a boon denied to his own
        subjects was the height of economic lunacy; the native merchants
        complained that the Venetians were enabled to undersell them in every
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269"
        id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> market, owing to this
        exemption from import and export duties. Matters were made yet worse
        in 1111, when Alexius bestowed a similar, though less extensive,
        grant of immunities on the Pisans.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When John II., the
        son of Alexius, succeeded in 1118 to the empire which his father had
        saved, the fabric was less strong than it appeared to the outward
        eye. Territorial extension seemed to imply increased strength, and
        the rapid falling off in the financial resources of the realm
        attracted little attention. John however was one of those prudent and
        economical princes who stave off for years the inevitable day of
        distress. Of all the rulers who ever sat upon the Byzantine throne,
        he is the only one of whom no detractor has ever said an evil word.
        When we remember that he was his father's son, it is astonishing to
        find that his honesty and good faith were no less notable than his
        courage and generosity. His subjects named him <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“John the Good,”</span> and their appreciation of his
        virtues was sufficiently marked by the fact that no single
        rebellion<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href=
        "#note_27"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a> marred
        the internal peace of his long reign. [1118-1143.]</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">John was a good
        soldier, and during his rule the frontier of the empire in Asia
        continued to advance, at the expense of the Turks. But his strategy
        would seem to have been at fault since he preferred to reconquer the
        coast districts of Northern and Southern Asia Minor, rather than to
        strike at the heart of the Seljouk power on the central table-land.
        When he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name=
        "Pg270" id="Pg270" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> had reduced all
        Cilicia, Pisidia, and Pontus, his dominions became a narrow fringe of
        coast, surrounding on three sides the realm of the Sultan, who still
        retained all the Cappadocian and Lycaonian plateau. It should then
        have been John's task to finish the reconquest of Asia Minor, but he
        preferred to plunge into Syria, where he forced the Frank prince of
        Antioch and the Turkish Emir of Aleppo to pay him tribute, but left
        no permanent monument of his conquests. He was preparing a formidable
        expedition against the Franks of the kingdom of Jerusalem, when he
        perished by accident while on a hunting expedition.<a id="noteref_28"
        name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">John the Good was
        succeeded by his son Manuel, whose strength and weakness combined to
        give a deathblow to the empire. Manuel was a mere knight-errant, who
        loved fighting for fighting's sake, and allowed his passion for
        excitement and adventure to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg
        271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> be
        his only guide. His whole reign was one long series of wars, entered
        into and abandoned with equal levity. Yet for the most part they were
        successful wars, for Manuel was a good cavalry officer if he was but
        a reckless statesman, and his fiery courage and untiring energy made
        him the idol of his troops. At the head of the veteran squadrons of
        mercenary horsemen that formed the backbone of his army, he swept off
        the field every enemy that ever dared to face him. He overran Servia,
        invaded Hungary, to whose king he dictated terms of peace, and beat
        off with success an invasion of Greece by the Normans of Sicily. His
        most desperate struggle, however, was a naval war with Venice, in
        which his fleet was successful enough, and drove the Doge and his
        galleys out of the Ægean. But the damage done to the trade of
        Constantinople by the Venetian privateers, who swarmed in the Levant
        after their main fleet had been chased away, was so appalling that
        the Emperor concluded peace in 1174, restoring to the enemy all the
        disastrous commercial privileges which his grandfather Alexius had
        granted them eight years before.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The main fault of
        Manuel's wars was that they were conducted in the most reckless
        disregard of all financial considerations. With a realm which was
        slowly growing poorer, and with a constantly dwindling revenue, he
        persisted in piling war on war, and on devoting every bezant that
        could be screwed out of his subjects to the support of the army
        alone. The civil service fell into grave disorder, the administration
        of justice was impaired, roads and bridges went to decay, docks and
        harbours were neglected, while <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the money which should have supported them was
        wasted on unprofitable expeditions to Egypt, Syria, or Italy. So long
        as the ranks of his mercenaries were full and their pay forthcoming,
        the Emperor cared not how his realm might fare.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of all Manuel's
        wars only one went ill, but that was the most important of them all,
        the one necessary struggle to which he should have devoted all his
        energies. This was the contest with the Seljouks, which ended in 1176
        by a disastrous defeat at Myriokephalon in Phrygia, brought about by
        the inexcusable carelessness of Manuel himself, who allowed his army
        to be caught in a defile from which there was no exit, and routed
        piecemeal by an enemy who could have made no stand on the open
        plains. Manuel then made peace, and left the Seljouks alone for the
        rest of his reign.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1180 Manuel
        died, and with him died the good fortune of the House of Comnenus.
        His son and heir, Alexius, was a boy of thirteen, and the inevitable
        contest for the regency, which always accompanied a minority, ensued.
        After two troubled years Andronicus Comnenus, a first cousin of the
        Emperor Manuel, was proclaimed Caesar, and took over the guardianship
        of the young Alexius. Andronicus was an unscrupulous ruffian, whose
        past life should have been sufficient warning against putting any
        trust in his professions. He had once attempted to assassinate
        Manuel, and twice deserted to the Turks. But he was a consummate
        hypocrite, and won his way to the throne by professions of piety and
        austere virtue. No sooner was he seated by the side of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Alexius II., and felt himself secure,
        than he seized and strangled his young relative [1183].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, like our own
        Richard III., Andronicus found that the moment of his accession to
        sole power was the moment of the commencement of his troubles. Rebels
        rose in arms all over the empire to avenge the murdered Alexius, and
        the Normans of Sicily seized the opportunity of invading Macedonia.
        Conspiracies were rife in the capital, and the executions which
        followed their detection were so numerous and bloody that a perfect
        reign of terror set in. The Emperor plunged into the most reckless
        cruelty, till men almost began to believe that his mind was affected.
        Ere long the end came. An inoffensive nobleman named Isaac Angelus,
        being accused of treason, was arrested at his own door by the
        emissaries of the tyrant. Instead of surrendering himself, Isaac drew
        his sword and cut down the official who laid hands on him. A mob came
        to his aid, and met no immediate opposition, for Andronicus was
        absent from the capital. The mob swelled into a multitude, the guards
        would not fight, and when the Emperor returned in haste, he was
        seized and torn to pieces without a sword being drawn in his cause.
        Isaac Angelus reigned in his stead.</p>

        Constantinople.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The state which
        had been drained of its resources by the energetic but wasteful
        Manuel, and disorganized by the rash and wicked Andronicus, now
        passed into the hands of the two most feeble and despicable creatures
        who ever sat upon the imperial throne—the brothers Isaac and Alexius
        Angelus, whose reigns cover the years 1185-1204.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among all the
        periods which we have hitherto described in the tale of the
        East-Roman Empire, that covered by the reign of the two wretched
        Angeli may be pronounced the most shameful. The peculiar disgrace of
        the period lies in the fact that the condition of the empire was not
        hopeless at the time. With ordinary courage and prudence it might
        have been held together, for the attacks directed against it were not
        more formidable than others which had been beaten off with ease. If
        the blow had fallen when a hero like Leo III., or even a statesman
        like Alexius I. was on the throne, there is no reason to doubt that
        it would have been parried. But it fell in the times of two
        incompetent triflers, who conducted the state <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> on the principle of, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”</span> Isaac
        and Alexius felt in themselves no power of redeeming the empire from
        the evil day, and resignedly fell back on personal enjoyment. Isaac's
        taste lay in the direction of gorgeous raiment and the collecting of
        miraculous <span class="tei tei-q">“eikons.”</span> Alexius preferred
        the pleasures of the table. Considered as sovereigns there was little
        to choose between them. Each was competent to ruin an empire already
        verging on its decline.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The disaster which
        the Angeli brought on their realm was rendered possible only by its
        complete military and financial disorganization. As a military power
        the empire had never recovered the effects of the Seljouk invasions,
        which had robbed it of its great recruiting-ground for its native
        troops in Asia Minor. After that loss the use of mercenaries had
        become more and more prevalent. The brilliant campaigns of Manuel
        Comnenus had been made at the head of a soldiery of whom two-thirds
        were not born-subjects of the empire. He, it is true, had kept them
        within the bounds of strict discipline, and contrived at all costs to
        provide their pay. But the weak and thriftless Angeli were able
        neither to find money nor to maintain discipline. A state which
        relies for its defence on foreign mercenaries is ruined, if it allows
        them to grow disorderly and inefficient. In times of stress they
        mutiny instead of fighting.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The civil
        administration was in almost as deplorable a condition, while those
        two <span class="tei tei-q">“Earthly Angels”</span> (as a
        contemporary chronicler called them) were charged with its care.
        Isaac Angelus put the finishing touch <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> to administrative abuses, which had already
        been rife enough under the Comneni, by exposing offices and posts to
        auction. Instead of paying his officials he <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“sent them forth without purse or scrip, like the
        apostles of old, to make what profit they could by extortion from the
        provincials.”</span><a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href=
        "#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> His
        brother Alexius promised on his accession to make all appointments on
        the ground of merit, but proved in reality as bad as Isaac. He was
        surrounded by a ring of rapacious favourites, who managed all
        patronage, and dispensed it in return for bribes. When high posts
        were not sold, they were given as douceurs to men of local influence,
        whose rebellion was dreaded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The history of the
        twenty years covered by the reigns of the two Angeli is cut into two
        equal halves at the deposition of Isaac by his brother in 1195. It is
        only necessary to point out how the responsibility for the disasters
        of the period is to be divided between them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Isaac's share
        consists in the loss of Bulgaria and Cyprus. The former country had
        now been in the hands of the Byzantines for nearly two hundred years,
        since its conquest by Basil II. But the Bulgarians had not merged in
        the general body of the subjects of the empire. They preserved their
        national language and customs, and never forgot their ancient
        independence. In 1187, three brothers named Peter, John, and Azan
        stirred up rebellion among them. If firmly treated it might have been
        crushed with ease by the regular troops of the empire. But Isaac
        first appointed incompetent generals, who let the rebellion grow to a
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277"
        id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> head, and when at last he
        placed an able officer, Alexis Branas, in command, his lieutenant
        took the opportunity of using his army for revolt. Branas marched
        against Constantinople, and would have taken it, had not Isaac
        committed the charge of the troops that remained faithful to him to
        stronger hands than his own. He bribed an able adventurer from the
        West, Conrad, Marquis of Montferrat, by the offer of his sister's
        hand and a great sum of money to become his saviour. The gallant
        Lombard routed the forces of Branas, slew the usurper, and preserved
        the throne for his brother-in-law. But while the civil war was going
        on, the Bulgarians were left unchecked, and made such head that there
        was no longer much apparent chance of subduing them. Isaac took the
        field against them in person, only to see the great towns of Naissus,
        Sophia, and Varna taken before his eyes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While a national
        revolt deprived the Emperor of Bulgaria, Cyprus was lost to a meaner
        force. Isaac Comnenus, a distant relative of the Emperor Manuel II.,
        raised rebellion among the Cypriots and defeated the fleet and army
        which his namesake of Constantinople sent against him. He held out
        for six years, and appeared likely to establish a permanent kingdom
        in the island. This revolt was of the worst augury to the empire. It
        had often lost provinces by the invasion of barbarian hordes, or the
        rebellion of subject nationalities. But that a native rebel should
        sever a civilized Greek province from the empire, and reign as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Emperor of Cyprus,”</span> was a new
        phenomenon. By the imperial theory the idea of an independent
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278"
        id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Empire of Cyprus”</span> was wholly monstrous and
        abnormal. The successful rebellion of Isaac Comnenus pointed to the
        possibility of a general breaking up of the Byzantine dominion into
        fragments, a danger that had never appeared before. Till now the
        provinces had always obeyed the capital, and no instance had been
        known of a rebel maintaining himself by any other way than the
        capture of Constantinople. Isaac Comnenus might, however, have
        founded a dynasty in Cyprus, if he had not quarrelled with Richard
        Coeur-de-Lion, the crusading King of England. When he maltreated some
        shipwrecked English crews, Richard punished him by landing his army
        in Cyprus and seizing the whole island. Isaac was thrown into a
        dungeon, and the English king gave his dominions to Guy of Lusignan,
        who called in Frank adventurers to settle up the land, and made it
        into a feudal kingdom of the usual Western type.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Isaac II.
        was in the midst of his Bulgarian war, and misconducting it with his
        usual fatuity, he was suddenly dethroned by a palace intrigue. His
        own brother, Alexius Angelus, had hatched a plot against him, which
        worked so successfully that Isaac was caught, blinded, and immured in
        a monastery long before his adherents knew that he was in danger.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alexius III. never
        showed any other proof of energy save this skilful <span lang="fr"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="fr"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">coup d`état</span></span> aimed against his
        brother. He continued the Bulgarian war with the same ill-success
        that had attended Isaac's dealings with it. He plunged into a
        disastrous struggle with the Seljouk Sultan of Iconium, and he
        quarrelled with the Emperor Henry VI., who would certainly have
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279"
        id="Pg279" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> invaded his dominions if death
        had not intervened to prevent it. But as long as Alexius was
        permitted to enjoy the pleasures of the table in his villas on the
        Bosphorus, the ill-success abroad of his arms and his diplomacy vexed
        him but little.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in 1203, a new
        and unexpected danger arose to scare him from his feasting. His blind
        brother Isaac had a young son named Alexius, who escaped from
        Constantinople to Italy, and took refuge with Philip of Suabia, the
        new Emperor of the West. Philip had married a daughter of Isaac
        Angelus, and determined to do something to help his young
        brother-in-law. The opportunity was not hard to seek. Just at this
        moment a large body of French, Flemish, and Italian Crusaders, who
        had taken arms at the command of the Pope, were lying idle at Venice.
        They had marched down to the great Italian seaport with the intention
        of directing a blow against Malek-Adel, Sultan of Egypt. The
        Venetians had contracted to supply them with vessels for the Crusade,
        but for reasons of their own had determined that the attack should
        not fall on the shore for which it had been destined. They were on
        very good terms with the Egyptian sovereign, who had granted them
        valuable commercial privileges at Alexandria, which threw the whole
        trade with the distant realms of India into Venetian hands.
        Accordingly they had determined to avert the blow from Egypt and turn
        it against some other enemy of Christendom. The leaders of the Fourth
        Crusade proved unable to pay the full sum which they had contracted
        to give the Venetians as ship-hire, and this was made an excuse for
        keeping <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name=
        "Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> them camped on the
        unhealthy islands in the Lagoons till their patience and their stores
        were alike exhausted. Henry Dandolo, the aged but wily doge, then
        proposed to the Crusaders that they should pay their way by doing
        something in aid of Venice. The Dalmatian town of Zara had lately
        revolted and done homage to the King of Hungary; if the Crusaders
        would recover it, the Venetian state would wipe out their debts and
        transport them whither they wished to go.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Crusaders had
        taken arms for a holy war against the Moslems. They were now invited
        to turn aside against a Christian town and interest themselves in
        Venetian politics. Conscientious men would have refused to join in
        such an unholy bargain, and would have insisted in carrying out their
        original purpose against Egypt. But conscientious men had been
        growing more and more rare among the Crusaders for the last hundred
        years. There were as many greedy military adventurers among them as
        single-hearted pilgrims. The more scrupulous chiefs were
        over-persuaded by their designing companions, and the expedition
        against Zara was undertaken.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Zara fell, but
        another and a more important enterprise was then placed before the
        Crusaders. While they wintered on the Dalmatian coast the young
        Alexius Angelus appeared in their camp, escorted by the ambassadors
        of his brother-in-law, the Emperor Philip of Suabia. The exiled
        prince besought them to turn aside once more before they sailed to
        the East, and to rescue his blind father from the dungeon into which
        he had been cast by his cruel brother Alexius III. If they would
        drive out the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg
        281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        usurper and restore the rightful ruler to his throne, they should
        have anything that the Byzantine Empire could afford to help them for
        their Crusade—money in plenty, stores, a war fleet, a force of
        mercenary troops, and his own presence as a helper in the war with
        Egypt.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pope Innocent III.
        had already been storming at the adventurers for shedding Christian
        blood at Zara, and tampering with their Crusader's oath. But the
        prospect of Byzantine gold seduced the needy Western barons, and the
        desire of keeping the war away from Egypt ruled the minds of the
        Venetians. They hesitated and began to treat with Alexius, though
        they knew that thereby they were calling down on themselves the
        terrors of a Papal excommunication. All now depended on the leaders,
        and among them the abler minds were set on the acceptance of the
        proposal of the young Byzantine exile. The three chiefs of the
        Crusade were the Doge Henry Dandolo, Boniface Marquis of Montferrat,
        and Baldwin Count of Flanders. In Dandolo the ruthless energy of the
        Italian Republics stood incarnate; he was the one man in the
        crusading army who knew exactly what he wanted. Old and blind, but
        clear-headed and inflexible, he was set on revenging an ancient
        grudge against the Greeks, and on furthering, by any means, good or
        evil, the fortunes of his native city. Baldwin and Boniface, the two
        secondary figures in the camp of the Franks, are perfect
        representations of the two types of crusader. The Fleming, gallant
        and generous, pious and debonnair, worthy of a more righteous
        enterprise and a more honourable death, was a true <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> successor of Godfrey of Bouillon, and the
        heroes of the First Crusade. The Lombard, a deep and hardy schemer,
        to whom force and fraud seemed equally good, was simply seeking for
        wealth and fame in the realms of the East. He cared little for the
        Holy Sepulchre, and much for his own private advancement. Behind
        these three leaders we descry the motley crowd of the feudal world;
        relic-hunting abbots in coats of mail, wrangling barons and penniless
        knights, the half-piratical seamen of Venice, and the brutal soldiery
        of the West.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Boniface of
        Montferrat and Doge Dandolo gradually talked over the more scrupulous
        Baldwin and his friends, and the crusading fleet was launched against
        Constantinople, after a treaty had been signed which bound Alexius
        Angelus and his blind father, Isaac II., to pay the Crusaders 200,000
        marks of silver, send ten thousand men to Palestine, and acknowledge
        the supremacy of the Pope over the Eastern Church. In these
        conditions lay the germs of much future trouble.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Crusading
        armament reached the Dardanelles without having to strike a blow. The
        slothful and luxurious emperor let things slide, and had not even a
        fleet ready to send against them in the Aegean. He shut himself up in
        Constantinople, and trusted to the strength of its walls to deliver
        him, as Heraclius and Leo III. and many more of his predecessors had
        been delivered. If the siege had been conducted from the land side
        only, his hopes might have been justified, for the Danes and English
        of the Varangian Guard beat back the assault of the Franks on the
        land-wall. But Alexius III., unlike earlier emperors, was attacked by
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284"
        id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a fleet to which he could
        oppose no adequate naval resistance. Though the Crusaders were driven
        off on shore, the Venetians stormed the sea-wall, by the expedient of
        building light towers on the decks, and throwing flying bridges from
        the towers on to the top of the Byzantine ramparts. The blind Doge
        pushed his galley close under the wall, and urged on his men again
        and again till they had won a lodgment in some towers on the port
        side of the sea-wall. The Venetians then fired the city, and a
        fearful conflagration followed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hearing that the
        enemy was within the ramparts, the cowardly Alexius III. mounted his
        horse and fled away into the inland of Thrace, leaving his troops,
        who were not yet half beaten, without a leader or a cause to fight
        for. The garrison bowed to necessity, and the chief officers of the
        army drew the aged Isaac II. out of his cloister prison and
        proclaimed his restoration to the throne. They sent to the Crusading
        camp to announce that hostilities had ceased, and to beg Prince
        Alexius to enter the city and join his father in the palace.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The end of the
        expedition of the Crusaders had now been attained, but it may safely
        be asserted that the chief feeling in their ranks was a bitter
        disappointment at being cheated out of the sack of Constantinople, a
        prospect over which they had been gloating ever since they left Zara.
        They spent the next three months in endeavouring to wring out of
        their triumphant protégés, Isaac and Alexius, every bezant that could
        be scraped together. The old emperor, already blind and gout-ridden,
        was driven to imbecility <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg
        285]</span><a name="Pg285" id="Pg285" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by
        their demands: his son was a raw, inexperienced youth who could
        neither be firm, nor frank, nor dignified in dealing with any one. He
        angered the Franks by insincere diplomacy, and the Greeks by his
        reckless schemes for extracting money from them. The winter of 1203-4
        was spent in ceaseless wrangling about the subsidy due to the
        Crusaders, till Alexius, growing seriously frightened, began
        exactions on his subjects which drove them to revolt. When he seized
        and melted down the golden lamps and silver candelabra which formed
        the pride of St. Sophia, stripped its eikonostasis of its rich metal
        plating, and requisitioned the jewelled eikons and reliquaries of
        every church in the city, the populace would stand his proceedings no
        longer. They would not serve an emperor who had sold himself to the
        Franks, and only reigned in order to subject the Eastern Church to
        Rome, and to pour the hoarded wealth of the ancient empire into the
        coffers of the upstart Italian republics.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In January, 1204,
        the storm burst. The populace and troops shut the gates of the city,
        and fell on the isolated Latins who were within the walls. They were
        not long without a leader; a fierce and unscrupulous officer named
        Alexius Ducas put himself at their head and determined to seize the
        throne. Isaac II. died of fright in the midst of the tumult; his son
        Alexius was caught and strangled by the usurper. Thus the Angeli
        ceased out of the land, and Alexius V. reigned in their stead. He is
        less frequently named by chroniclers under his family name of Ducas,
        than under his nickname of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Murtzuphlus,”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> drawn from the bushy overhanging eyebrows which
        formed the most prominent feature of his countenance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alexius Ducas had
        everything against him. He was a mere usurper, whose authority was
        hardly recognized beyond the walls of Constantinople. The Angeli had
        so drained the treasury that nothing remained in it. Twenty years of
        indiscipline and disaster had spoilt the army; the fleet was
        nonexistent, for the admirals of Alexius Angelus had laid up the
        vessels in ordinary, and sold the stores to fill their own pockets.
        Nevertheless Murtzuphlus made a far better fight than his despicable
        predecessor and namesake. He collected a little money by confiscating
        the properties of the unpopular courtiers and ministers of the
        Angeli, and used it to the best advantage. The army received some of
        the arrears due to them, and Alexius spent every spare moment in
        seeing to their drill and endeavouring to improve their discipline.
        He strengthened the sea-wall, whose weakness had been proved so
        fatally four months ago, by erecting wooden towers along it, and
        building platforms for all the military engines that could be found
        in the arsenal. He ordered, too, the enrolment of a national militia,
        and compelled the nobles and burghers of Constantinople to take arms
        and man the walls. To the discredit of the Byzantines this order was
        received with many murmurs: the citizens complained that they paid
        taxes to support the regular army, and that they therefore ought to
        be excused personal service. Little good was got out of these new and
        raw levies; they swelled the numbers <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the garrison, but hardly added anything
        appreciable to its strength.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alexius Ducas
        himself with his cavalry scoured the country round the Crusading camp
        every day, to cut off the foraging parties of the Franks, and when
        not in the field, rode round the city superintending the works,
        inspecting the guard-posts, and haranguing the soldiery. If courage
        and energy command success, he ought to have held his own. But he
        could not counteract the work of twenty years of decay and
        disorganization, and felt that his throne rested on the most fragile
        of foundations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Crusaders took
        two months to prepare for their second assault on Constantinople,
        which they felt would be a far more formidable affair than the attack
        in the preceding autumn. They directed their chief efforts against
        the sea-wall, which they had found vulnerable in the previous siege,
        and left the formidable land-wall alone. The ships were told off into
        groups, each destined to attack a particular section of the wall, and
        covered with as many military engines as they could carry. Flying
        bridges were again prepared, and landing parties were directed to
        leap ashore on the narrow beach between the wall and the water, and
        get to work with rams and scaling ladders. The attack was made on
        April 8th, at more than a hundred points along two miles of sea-wall,
        but it was beaten off with loss. Alexius Ducas had made his
        arrangements so well, that the fire of his engines swept off all who
        attempted to gain a footing on the ramparts. The ships were much
        damaged, and at noon the whole fleet gave back, and retired
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288"
        id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> as best it could to the
        opposite side of the Golden Horn.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many of the
        Crusaders were now for returning; they thought their defeat was a
        judgment for turning their arms against a Christian city, and wished
        to sail for the Holy Land. But Dandolo and the Venetians insisted
        upon repeating the assault. Three days were spent in repairing the
        fleet, and on April 12th a second attack was delivered. This time the
        ships were lashed together in pairs to secure stability, and the
        attack was concentrated on a comparatively small front of wall. At
        last, after much fighting, the military engines of the fleet and the
        bolts of its crossbowmen cleared a single tower of its defenders. A
        bridge was successfully lowered on to it, and a footing secured by a
        party of Crusaders, who then threw open a postern gate and let the
        main body in. After a short fight within the walls, the troops of
        Alexius Ducas retired back into the streets. The Crusaders fired the
        city to cover their advance, and by night were in possession of the
        north-west angle of Constantinople, the quarter of the palace of
        Blachern.</p>

        in the garrison, chose this moment to demand that their arrears of

        their money! The twenty years of disorganization under the Angeli was

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alexius Ducas, in
        despair at being unable to make his men fight, left the city by
        night. He was soon followed by the last Greek officer who kept his
        head, the general Theodore Lascaris, who endeavoured to make one
        final attack on the Crusaders even after his master had departed.
        Next morning the Franks found themselves in full possession of the
        city, though they had been expecting to face a hard day of
        street-fighting before this end could be attained.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In cold blood,
        twelve hours after all fighting had ended, the Crusaders proceeded
        with great deliberation to sack the place. The leaders could not or
        would not hold back their men, and every atrocity that attends the
        storm of a great city was soon in full swing. Though no resistance
        was made, the soldiery, and especially the Venetians, took life
        recklessly, and three or four thousand unarmed citizens were slain.
        But there was no general massacre; it was lust and greed rather than
        bloodthirstiness that the army displayed. All the Western writers, no
        less than the Greeks, testify to the horrors of the three days'
        carnival of rape and plunder that now set in. Every knight or soldier
        seized on the house that he liked best, and dealt as he chose with
        its inmates. Churches and nunneries fared no better than private
        dwellings; the orgies that were enacted in the holiest places caused
        even the Pope to exclaim that no good could ever come out of the
        conquest. The drunken soldiery enthroned a harlot in the patriarchal
        chair in St. Sophia, and made her rehearse ribald songs and indecent
        dances before the high altar. There were plenty of clergy with the
        Crusading army, but instead of endeavouring to check the sacrilegious
        doings of their countrymen, they devoted themselves to plundering the
        treasuries of the churches of all the holy bones and relics that were
        stored in them. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Franks,”</span> remarked
        a Greek writer who saw the sack of Constantinople, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“behaved far worse than Saracens; the infidels when a
        town has surrendered at any rate respect churches and
        women.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After private
        plunder had reigned unchecked for <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page291">[pg 291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> three days, the leaders of the Crusaders
        collected such valuables as could be found for public division.
        Though so much had been stolen and concealed, they were able to
        produce no less than £800,000 in hard gold and silver for
        distribution. The sum was afterwards supplemented by the use of a
        resource which makes the modern historian add a special curse of his
        own to the account of the Crusaders. Down to 1204 Constantinople
        still contained the monuments of ancient Greek art in enormous
        numbers. In spite of the wear and tear of 900 years, her squares and
        palaces were still crowded with the art-treasures that Constantine
        and his sons had stored up. Nicetas, who was an eyewitness of all,
        has left us the list of the chief statues that suffered. The Heracles
        of Lysippus, the great Hera of Samos, the brass figures which
        Augustus set up after Actium, the ancient Roman bronze of the Wolf
        with Romulus and Remus, Paris with the Golden Apple, Helen of Troy,
        and dozens more all went into the melting-pot, to be recast into
        wretched copper money. The monuments of Christian art fared no
        better; the tombs of the emperors were carefully stripped of
        everything in metal, the altars and screens of the churches scraped
        to the stone. Everything was left bare and desolate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such was
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the greatest conquest that was ever seen,
        greater than any made by Alexander or Charlemagne, or by any that
        have lived before or after,”</span> as a Western chronicler wrote,
        while the Greeks grew hyperbolical in lamentation, as they saw
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the eye of the world, the ornament of
        nations, the fairest sight on earth, the mother of churches, the
        spring whence <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg
        292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        flowed the waters of faith, the mistress of Orthodox doctrine, the
        seat of the sciences, draining the cup mixed for her by the hand of
        the Almighty, and consumed by fires as devouring as those which
        ruined the five Cities of the Plain.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last the
        Crusaders sat down to divide up their conquests. They elected Baldwin
        of Flanders Emperor of the East, and handed over to him the ruined
        city of Constantinople, half of it devoured by the flames of the
        conflagrations that attended the two sieges, and all of it plundered
        from cellar to attic. Four-fifths of the population had fled, and no
        one had remained save beggars who had nothing to save by flight. With
        the capital Baldwin was given Thrace and the Asiatic
        provinces—Bithynia, Mysia, and Lydia, all of which had still to be
        conquered. His colleague, Boniface of Montferrat, was made
        <span class="tei tei-q">“King of Thessalonica,”</span> and did homage
        to Baldwin for a fief consisting of Macedonia, Thessaly, and inland
        Epirus. The Venetians claimed <span class="tei tei-q">“a quarter and
        half-a-quarter”</span> of the empire, and took out their share by
        receiving Crete, the Ionian Islands, the ports along the west coast
        of Greece and Albania, nearly the whole of the islands of the Aegean,
        and the land about the entrance of the Dardanelles. They seized on
        every good harbour and strong sea-fortress, but left the inland
        alone; commerce rather than annexation was their end. The rest of the
        empire was parcelled out among the minor leaders of the Crusade; they
        had first to conquer their fiefs, and were then to do homage for them
        to the Emperor Baldwin. Most of them never lived to <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> accomplish the scheme. Meanwhile a
        Venetian prelate was appointed patriarch of Constantinople, and news
        was sent to the Pope that the union of the Eastern and Western
        Churches was accomplished, by the forcible extinction of the Greek
        patriarchate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It only remains to
        speak of Alexius Ducas, the fugitive Greek emperor. He fell into the
        hands of the Crusaders, was tried for the murder of the young Alexius
        Angelus, and suffered death by being taken to the top of a lofty
        pillar and hurled from it. The Greeks saw in this strange end the
        fulfilment of an obscure prophecy about the last of the Caesars,
        which had long puzzled the brains of the oracle-mongers.</p>

        <span style="font-size: 173%">XXIII. The Latin Empire And The Empire
        Of Nicaea. (1204-1261.)</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seldom has any
        state dragged out fifty-seven years in such constant misery and
        danger as the Latin Empire experienced in the course of its
        inglorious existence. The whole period was one protracted
        death-agony, and at no date within it did there appear any reasonable
        prospect of recovery. Thirty thousand men can take a city, but they
        cannot subdue a realm 800 miles long and 400 broad. Far more than any
        government which has since held sway on the same spot did the Latin
        Empire of Romania deserve the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        Sick Man.”</span> It is not too much to say that but for the
        unequalled strength of the walls of Constantinople the new power must
        have ceased to exist within ten years of its establishment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But once fortified
        within the ramparts of Byzantium the Franks enjoyed the inestimable
        advantage which their Greek predecessors had possessed: they were
        masters of a fortress which—as military science then <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> stood—was practically impregnable, if
        only it was defended with ordinary skill, and adequately guarded on
        the front facing the sea. As long as the Venetians kept up their
        naval supremacy in Eastern waters, the city was safe on that side,
        and even the very limited force which the Latin emperor could put
        into the field sufficed, when joined to the armed burghers of the
        Italian quarters, to defend the tremendous land wall.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the first
        year of its existence the Latin Empire was marked out by unfailing
        signs as a power not destined to continue. The intention of its
        founders had been to replace the centralized despotism which they had
        overthrown by a great feudal state, corresponding in territorial
        extent to its predecessor. But within a few months it became evident
        that the conquest of the broad provinces which the Crusaders had
        distributed among themselves by anticipation, was not to be carried
        out. The new emperor himself was the first to discover this. He set
        out with his chivalry to drive from Northern Thrace the Bulgarian
        hordes, who had flocked down into the plains to profit by the plunder
        of the dismembered realm. But near Adrianople he met Joannicios, the
        Bulgarian king, with a vast army at his back. The Franks charged
        gallantly enough, but they were simply overwhelmed by numbers. The
        larger part of the army was cut to pieces, and Baldwin himself was
        taken prisoner. The Bulgarian kept him in chains for some months, and
        then put him to death, after he had worn the imperial crown only one
        year [1205].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Henry of Flanders,
        the brother of Baldwin, became <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> his successor. He was an honest and able man,
        but he could do nothing towards conquering the provinces of Asia,
        pushing the Bulgarians back over the Balkans, or conciliating the
        subject Greek population. All his reign he had to fight on the
        defensive against his neighbours to the north and south. By the time
        that he died the empire was practically confined to a narrow slip of
        land along the Propontis, reaching from Gallipoli to Constantinople.
        Nor was the chief of the minor Latin states any better off; Boniface
        of Montferrat had fallen in 1207, slain in battle by the same
        Bulgarian hordes which had cut off the army of his suzerain Baldwin.
        With his death it became evident that the kingdom of Thessalonica was
        no more able to conquer all the old Byzantine provinces in its
        neighbourhood than was the empire of Constantinople. Boniface's son
        and heir was a mere infant; during his minority the lands of his
        kingdom were lopped away, one after another, by the Greek despot of
        Epirus, the able Theodore Angelus. At last the capital itself was
        retaken by the Greeks in 1222, and the kingdom of Thessalonica came
        to an end.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Latin states
        in the southern parts of the Balkan Peninsula fared somewhat better.
        William of Champlitte had contrived to hew out for himself a
        principality in the western parts of the Peloponnesus, and had
        organized there a small state with twelve baronies and 136 knights
        fees. The resistance of the natives in this district was particularly
        weak, and one battle sufficed to give William all the coast-plain of
        Elis and Messenia. Yet he did not succeed in <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297" id="Pg297" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> subduing the mountaineers of the peninsula of
        Maina, or the coast towns of Argolis and Laconia, so that the Greeks
        still had some foothold in the peninsula.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another small
        Latin state was set up by Otho de la Roche in Central Greece, where
        as <span class="tei tei-q">“Duke of Athens”</span> he ruled Attica
        and Boeotia. He treated his Greek subjects with more consideration
        than any of his fellow Crusaders, and was rewarded by obtaining a
        degree of respect and deference which was not found in any other
        Latin state. Though the smallest, the duchy of Athens was undoubtedly
        the most prosperous of the new creations of the conquest of 1204.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile it is
        time to speak of the fortunes of those parts of the Eastern Empire
        which the Franks did not succeed in seizing when Constantinople fell.
        The provinces had hitherto been accustomed to accept without a murmur
        the ruler whom the capital obeyed. But in 1204 it was found that the
        centralization of the Byzantine Empire, great as it was, had not so
        thoroughly crushed the individuality of the provinces as to make them
        submit without resistance to the Latin yoke. Wherever the provincials
        found a leader, whether a member of one of the ex-imperial houses, or
        an energetic governor, or a landholder of local influence, they stood
        up to defend themselves. The Byzantine Empire, like some creature of
        low organism, showed every sign of life in its limbs, though its head
        had been shorn off. Wherever a centre of resistance could be found
        the people refused to submit to the piratical Frank, and to his yet
        more hated companions the priests of the Roman
        Church.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg
        298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the nine or ten
        leaders who put themselves at the head of provincial risings three
        were destined to carve out kingdoms for themselves. Of these the most
        important was Theodore Lascaris, the last officer who had attempted
        to strike a blow against the Franks when Constantinople fell.<a id=
        "noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        claim some shadow of hereditary right to the imperial crown as he had
        married the daughter of the imbecile Alexius III., but his true title
        was his well-approved courage and energy. The wrecks of the old
        Byzantine army rallied around him, the cities of Bithynia opened
        their gates, and when the Latins crossed into Asia to divide up the
        land into baronies and knights fees, they found Theodore waiting to
        receive them with the sword. His defence of the strong town of Prusa,
        which successfully repelled Henry of Flanders, put a limit to the
        extension of the Frank Empire; beyond a few castles on the Bithynian
        coast they made no conquests. Having thus checked the invaders,
        Theodore had himself solemnly crowned at Nicaea, and assumed imperial
        state [1206].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having beaten off
        the Latins, Theodore had to cope with another who aspired like
        himself to pose as the rightful heir to the imperial throne. Alexius
        Comnenus, a grandson of the wicked emperor Andronicus I., had betaken
        himself to the Eastern frontiers of the empire when Constantinople
        fell, and obtained possession of Trebizond and the long slip of
        coast-land at the south-east corner of the Black Sea, from the mouth
        of the Phasis to Sinope. He aspired to conquer the whole of Byzantine
        Asia, and sent his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg
        299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        brother David Comnenus to attack Bithynia. But Theodore defended his
        newly won realm with success; Comnenus gained no territory from him,
        and was constrained to content himself with the narrow bounds of his
        Pontic realm, where his descendants reigned in obscurity for three
        hundred years as emperors of Trebizond. A greater danger beset the
        empire of Nicaea when the warlike sultan of the Seljouks came down
        from his plateau to ravage its borders. But the valour of Theodore
        Lascaris triumphed over this enemy also. In the battle of
        Antioch-on-Maeander he slew Sultan Kaikhosru with his own hand in
        single <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg 300]</span><a name=
        "Pg300" id="Pg300" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> combat, and the Turks
        were beaten back with such slaughter that they left the empire alone
        for a generation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile a third
        Greek state had sprung into existence in the far West. Michael
        Angelus, a cousin of Alexius III. and Isaac II., put in a claim to
        their heritage, though he was disqualified by his illegitimate birth.
        He was recognized as ruler by the cities of Epirus, and proclaimed
        himself <span class="tei tei-q">“despot”</span> of that land. Raising
        an army among the warlike tribes of Albania, he maintained his
        position with success, and discomfited the Franks of Athens and
        Thessalonica when they took arms against him. He died early, but left
        a compact heritage to his brother Theodore, who succeeded him on the
        throne, and within a few years conquered the whole of the Frank
        kingdom of Thessalonica.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was soon
        evident that there would be a trial of strength between the two Greek
        emperors who claimed to succeed to the rights of the dispossessed
        Angeli. The Latin Empire was obviously destined to fall before one of
        them. The only doubt was, whether the Epirot or the Nicene was to be
        its conqueror. This question was not settled till 1241, when the two
        powers met in decisive conflict.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this time
        Theodore Lascaris had been succeeded in Asia by his son-in-law John
        Ducas,<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href=
        "#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> and
        Theodore of Thessalonica by his son John Angelus. At Constantinople
        the succession of Latin emperors had been much more rapid. Henry of
        Flanders had died in 1216; he was followed by Peter of Courtenay, who
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301"
        id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was slain by the Epirots in
        less than a year. To him succeeded Robert his son, and when Robert
        died in 1228 his brother Baldwin II., reigned in his stead. The young
        Courtenays were both thoroughly incapable, and saw their empire melt
        away from them till nothing was left beyond the walls of
        Constantinople itself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">John III. of
        Nicaea was an excellent sovereign, a very worthy heir to his gallant
        father-in-law. Not only was he a good soldier and an able
        administrator, but by constant supervision and strict frugality he
        had got the financial condition of his empire into a more hopeful
        condition—a state of things which had never been seen in Romania
        since the time of John Comnenus, a hundred years before. In 1230 the
        troops of Nicaea crossed into Europe, and drove the Franks out of
        Southern Thrace, while in 1235 John Ducas laid siege to
        Constantinople itself. But the time of its fall was not yet arrived,
        and when a Venetian fleet approached to succour it the Emperor was
        constrained to raise the siege.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Recognizing that
        Constantinople was not yet ripe for its fall, John Ducas resolved to
        measure himself with his rivals the Angeli of Thessalonica. He beat
        their forces out of the field, and laid siege to their capital in
        1341. Then John Angelus engaged to resign the title of emperor, call
        himself no more than <span class="tei tei-q">“despot of
        Epirus,”</span> and to acknowledge himself as the vassal of the ruler
        of Nicaea. This satisfied Ducas for a time, but when Angelus died,
        four years later, he seized Thessalonica and united it to the
        imperial crown. The heir of the Angeli escaped to Albania
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg 303]</span><a name="Pg303"
        id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and succeeded in retaining a
        small fraction only of his ancestral dominions [1246].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">John Ducas died in
        1254, leaving the throne of Nicaea to his son Theodore II., who bid
        fair to continue the prosperous career of his father and grandfather.
        He drove the Bulgarians out of Macedonia, and penned the Albanians
        into their hills. But he became subject to epileptic fits, and died
        after a reign of only four years, before he had reached the age of
        thirty-eight [1258].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was a
        dreadful misfortune for the empire, for John Ducas, the son and heir
        of Theodore, was a child of eight years, and minorities were always
        disastrous to the state. We have seen in the history of previous
        centuries how frequently the infancy of a prince led to a violent
        contest for the place of regent, or even to a usurpation of the
        throne. The case of John IV. was no exception to the rule; the
        ministers of his father fought and intrigued to gain possession of
        the helm of affairs, till at last an able and unprincipled general,
        named Michael Paleologus, thrusting himself to the front, was named
        tutor to the Emperor, and given the title of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Despot.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Michael was as
        ambitious as he was unscrupulous. The place of regent was far from
        satisfying his ambition, and he determined to seize the throne,
        though he had steeped himself to the lips in oaths of loyalty to his
        young master. He played much the same game that Richard III. was
        destined to repeat in England two centuries later. He cleared away
        from the capital the relatives and adherents of the little prince,
        placed creatures of his own in their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> places, and conciliated the clergy by large
        gifts and hypocritical piety. Presently the partisans of Michael
        began to declaim against the dangers of a minority, and the necessity
        for a strong hand at the helm. After much persuasion and mock
        reluctance the regent was induced to allow himself to be crowned.
        From that moment the boy John Ducas was thrust aside and ignored: ere
        he had reached the age of ten his wicked guardian put out his eyes
        and plunged him into a dungeon, where he spent thirty years in
        darkness and misery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The usurpation of
        Michael tempted all the enemies of the Greek Empire to take arms. The
        Epirot despot allied himself with the Frankish lords of Greece, and
        their united armies, aided by auxiliaries from Italy, invaded
        Macedonia; moreover the Latin emperor of Constantinople stirred up
        the Venetians to ravage his neighbours' borders. But in 1260 the
        troops of Michael won, over the allied armies of the Franks and
        Epirots, the last great victory that a Byzantine army was ever
        destined to achieve. The field of Pelagonia decided the lot of the
        house of Paleologus, for Michael's enemies were so crushed that they
        could never afterwards make head against him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Freed from all
        danger from the West, Michael was now able to turn against
        Constantinople, and complete the reconstruction of the empire. The
        city was ripe for its fall, and Baldwin of Courtenay had long been
        awaiting his doom.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The long reign of
        the last Latin sovereign of Constantinople is sufficiently
        characterized by the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg
        305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        fact that Baldwin spent nearly half the years of his rule outside the
        bounds of Romania, as he wandered from court to court in the West,
        striving to stir up some champion who would deliver him from the
        inevitable destruction impending over his realm. He gained little by
        his tours, his greatest success being that, in 1244, he got from St.
        Louis a considerable sum of ready money in acknowledgment of the
        liberality with which he had presented the holy king with a choice
        selection of relics, including the rod of Moses, the jawbone of John
        the Baptist, and our Lord's crown of thorns.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1261 Baldwin
        was in worse straits than ever. He was stripping off the lead of his
        own palace roof, to sell it for a few zecchins to the Venetians, and
        burning the beams of his outhouses in default of money to buy fuel.
        His son and heir was in pawn to the Venetian banking firm of the
        Capelli, who had taken him as the only tangible security that could
        be found for a modest loan which they had advanced to the imperial
        exchequer. With the government in such a desperate condition there
        was no longer any power of resistance left in Constantinople. When
        the Venetian fleet, the sole remaining defence of the empire, was
        away at sea, the city fell before a sudden and unpremeditated attack,
        made by Alexius Strategopulus, commander in Thrace under the emperor
        Michael.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alexius, with
        eight hundred regular troops and a few scores of half-armed
        volunteers, was admitted by treachery within the walls. Before this
        formidable array the heirs of the Crusaders fled in base dismay,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306"
        id="Pg306" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and the Empire of Romania came
        to an inglorious and a well-deserved end.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Its monarch
        resumed his habitual mendicant tours in Western Europe, and never
        ceased to besiege the ears of popes and kings with demands for aid to
        recover his lost realm. At last Baldwin passed away: his sole
        memorial is the fact that he made a distressed and itinerant emperor
        in search of a champion, one of the stock figures in the Romances of
        his day. No one in Western Europe was ignorant of his tale, and he
        survives as the prototype of the dispossessed sovereigns of fifty
        legends of chivalry.</p>

        (1261-1328.)</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was now once
        more a Byzantine empire, and to an unobservant reader the history of
        the reigns of the Paleologi looks like the natural continuation and
        sequel of the history of the reigns of Isaac Angelus and his brother.
        If the annals of Michael VIII. and his son were written on to the end
        of that of Alexius Angelus, the intervening gap of the Latin Conquest
        might almost pass unperceived, and the reader might imagine that he
        was investigating a single continuous course of events. The Frank
        dominion at Constantinople, and the heroic episode of the Empire of
        Nicaea, would pass equally unnoticed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We need not insist
        on the perniciousness of such a view. Great as may seem the
        similarity of the Byzantine Empire of 1204, and that of 1270, it had
        really suffered an entire transformation in that period. To commence
        by the most obvious and external sign of change, it will be observed
        that the lands subject <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg
        308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to
        Michael Paleologus were far more limited in extent than those which
        had obeyed Alexius Angelus. The loss in Asia was less than might have
        been expected: Theodore Lascaris and John Ducas had kept back the
        Turk, and only two districts of no great extent had fallen into
        Moslem hands—the Pisidian coast with the seaport of Adalia on the
        south, and the Paphlagonian coast with the seaport of Sinope on the
        north. Besides these the distant Pontic province had now become the
        empire of Trebizond.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Europe the loss
        was far more serious: four great blocks of territory had been lost
        for ever. The first was a slip along the southern slope of the
        Balkans, in Northern Thrace and Macedonia, which had fallen into the
        hands of the Bulgarians, and become completely Slavonized. The second
        was the district which is represented by the modern land of Albania.
        When the Angeli of Thessalonica fell before John Ducas, a younger
        member of the house retired to the original mountain house of the
        dynasty, and preserved the independence of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Despotate of Epirus.”</span> Here the Angeli survived
        for some generations, maintaining themselves against the Emperors of
        Constantinople by a strict alliance with the Latin princes of
        Southern Greece.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next in the list
        of Old-Byzantine territories which Michael never recovered, we must
        place Greece proper, now divided between the Princes of Achaia, of
        the house of Villehardouin, and the Briennes, who had succeeded to
        the Duchy of Athens. But the Paleologi still retained a considerable
        slice of the Peloponnesus, and were destined to encroach ere
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309"
        id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> long on their Frankish
        neighbours. Lastly, we must mention the islands of the Aegean, of
        which the large majority were held either by the Venetian government,
        or by Venetian adventurers, who ruled as independent lords, but
        subordinated their policy to that of their native state.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
        territorial difference between the empire of 1204 and the empire of
        1261 was only one of the causes which crippled the realm of the
        Paleologi. Bad though the internal government of the dominions of
        Alexius III. had been, there was still then some hope of recovery.
        The old traditions of East-Roman administrative economy, though
        neglected, were not lost, and might have been revived by an emperor
        who had a keen eye to discover ability and a ready hand to reward
        merit. New blood in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">personnel</span></em> of the ministry, and a
        keen supervision of details by the master's eye, would have produced
        an improvement in the state of the empire, though any permanent
        restoration of strength was probably made impossible by the
        deep-seated decay of society. But by the time of Michael Paleologus
        even amelioration had become impossible. The three able emperors who
        reigned at Nicaea, though they had preserved their independence
        against Turk and Frank, had utterly failed in restoring
        administrative efficiency in their provinces. John Vatatzes, himself
        a thrifty monarch, who could even condescend to poultry-farming to
        fill his modest exchequer, found that all his efforts to protect
        native industry could not cause the dried-up springs of prosperity to
        flow again. The whole fiscal and administrative <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> machinery of government had been thrown
        hopelessly out of gear.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the
        commercial decline of the empire that made a reform of the
        administration so hopeless. The Paleologi were never able to reassert
        the old dominion over the seas which had made their predecessors the
        arbiters of the trade of Christendom. The wealth of the elder
        Byzantine Empire had arisen from the fact that Constantinople was the
        central emporium of the trade of the civilized world. All the caravan
        routes from Syria and Persia converged thither. Thither, too, had
        come by sea the commodities of Egypt and the Euxine. All the Eastern
        products which Europe might require had to be sought in the
        storehouses of Constantinople, and for centuries the nations of the
        West had been contented to go thither for them. But the Crusades had
        shaken this monopoly, when they taught the Italians to seek the
        hitherto unknown parts of Syria and Egypt, and buy their Eastern
        merchandize from the producer and not from the middleman. Acre and
        Alexandria had already profited very largely at the expense of
        Constantinople ere the Byzantine Empire was upset in 1204. But the
        Latin conquest was the fatal blow. It threw the control of the trade
        of the Bosphorus into the hands of the Venetians, and the Venetians
        had no desire to make Constantinople their one central mart: they
        were just as ready to trade through the Syrian and Egyptian ports. To
        them the city was no more than an important half-way house for the
        Black Sea trade, and an emporium for the local produce of the
        countries round the Sea of Marmora.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From 1204 onward
        Italy rather than Constantinople became the centre and starting-place
        for all European trade, and the great Italian republics employed all
        their vigilance to prevent the Greek fleet from recovering its old
        strength. Henceforth the Byzantine war-navy was insignificant, and
        without a war-navy the Paleologi could not drive away the intruders
        and restore the free navigation of the Levant to their own mercantile
        marine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The emperors who
        succeeded each other on the restored throne of Constantinople were,
        without exception, men more fitted to lose than to hold together an
        exhausted and impoverished empire. Their lot was cast, it is true, in
        hard times; but hardly one of them showed a spark of ability or
        courage in endeavouring to face the evil day. The three monarchs of
        the house of Lascaris who ruled at Nicaea had been keen soldiers and
        competent administrators, but with the return of the emperors to
        Constantinople the springs of energy began to dry up, and the gloom
        and decay of the ruined capital seemed to affect the spirit and brain
        of its rulers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Michael
        Paleologus, though it was his fortune to recover the city which his
        abler predecessors had failed to take, was a mere wily intriguer, not
        a statesman or general. Having usurped the throne by the basest
        treachery towards his infant sovereign, he always feared for himself
        a similar fate. Suspicion and cruelty were his main characteristics,
        and in his care for his own person he quite forgot the interests of
        the State. Even contemporary chroniclers saw that he was deliberately
        setting himself to weaken <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg
        313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        empire, because he dreaded the resentment of his subjects. He
        disbanded nearly all the native Greek troops, and refrained as far as
        possible from employing Greek generals.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of his minor
        acts in this direction may be said to have been the original
        circumstance which set the Ottoman Turks, the future bane of the
        empire, on their career of conquest. The borders of the empire in
        Asia were defended by a native militia, who held their lands under
        condition of defending the castles and passes of the Bithynian and
        Phrygian mountains. The institution, which somewhat resembled a
        simple form of European feudalism, had worked so well that the
        Byzantine Empire had for a century and a half kept its Asiatic
        frontier practically intact, in spite of all the pressure of the
        Seljouk Turks of the Sultanate of Iconium. But the Bithynian militia
        were known to be attached to the house of Ducas, which Michael had
        dethroned, and he therefore resolved to disarm them. The measure was
        carried out, not without bloodshed, but the disbanded levy were not
        replaced by any adequate number of regular troops. Michael's
        financial straits did not permit him to keep under arms a very large
        force, such as was required to garrison his eastern line of forts
        after the abolition of the previous machinery of defence. Ten years
        only before Othman, the father of the Ottoman Turks, succeeded to the
        petty principality which was destined to be the nucleus of the
        Turkish Empire, the way for him had been thrown open by Michael's
        suspicious disarmament of the guards of his own
        frontier.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg
        314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Michael lived for
        twenty-one years after the recovery of Constantinople, but he did not
        win a single important advantage in all the rest of his reign. In
        Europe he barely held his own against the Bulgarians, the Franks, and
        the fleets of Genoa and Venice. The troubles which befell him at the
        hands of the two naval powers were largely of his own creation, for
        he shifted his alliance from one to the other with such levity and
        suddenness that both regarded him as unfriendly. Though all through
        his reign he was at war either with Genoa or Venice, yet such was the
        distrust felt for him that, when at war with one of the rivals, he
        could not always secure the help of the other. Venice had been the
        mainstay of the Frank emperors of Constantinople, and Michael might,
        therefore, have been expected to remain staunch to the Genoese. On
        the other hand, the Genoese had designs on the Black Sea trade, which
        touched the Emperor's pocket very closely, while the Venetians were
        more connected with the distant commerce of Syria and Egypt, which
        did not concern him. Balancing one consideration with the other,
        Michael played false to both the powers, and often saw his coast
        ravaged and his small fleet compelled to take refuge in the Golden
        Horn, while the enemy's vessels swept the seas. On land he was less
        unlucky, and the Duke of Athens and the despot of Epirus were both
        kept in check, though neither of them were subdued.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it was in Asia
        that Michael's rule was most unfortunate. In the second half of his
        reign the Seljouks, though split into several principalities owing to
        the break up of the Sultanate of Iconium, united <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to assail the borders of the empire. They
        conquered the Carian and Lydian inland, though Tralles and several
        other towns made a vigorous resistance, and reduced Michael's
        dominion in South-western Asia Minor to a mere strip along the coast.
        A similar fate befell Eastern Bithynia, where the Turks forced their
        way as far as the river Sangarius.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the ruin of
        Byzantine Asia was reserved to fall into the times of Michael's son
        and successor, Andronicus II. This prince had all the faults of his
        father, levity, perfidy, and cruelty, with others added from which
        Michael had been free—cowardice and superstition. The main interest
        which Andronicus took in life was concerned with things
        ecclesiastical—it would be wrong to say things religious—and he spent
        his life in making and unmaking patriarchs of Constantinople. No
        prelate could bear with him long, and in the course of his reign he
        deposed no less than nine of them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Andronicus
        was quarrelling with his patriarchs the empire was going to ruin. The
        Seljouk chiefs from the plateau of Asia Minor were pressing down more
        and more towards the coast, and making their way to the very gates of
        Ephesus and Smyrna. At last the emperor, growing seriously alarmed
        when the Turks appeared on the shores of the Propontis itself, and
        threatened the walls of Nicaea and Prusa, resolved to make an
        unwonted effort to beat them back.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1302 the long
        war of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sicilian Vespers”</span> between
        the houses of Anjou and Aragon came to an end, and the hordes of
        mercenaries of all nations <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg
        317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        which the two pretenders to the crown of Sicily had maintained were
        turned loose on the world. It occurred to Andronicus that he might
        hire enough of the veterans of the Sicilian war to enable him to beat
        back the Turks into their hills. All Europe acknowledged that they
        were the hardiest and best-disciplined troops in Christendom, though
        they were also the most cruel and lawless. Accordingly the emperor
        applied to Roger de Flor, a renegade Templar, the commander of the
        mercenaries who had served Frederic of Aragon, and offered to take
        him into his service, with as many of his followers as could be
        induced to accompany him. Roger accepted with alacrity, and came to
        Constantinople in 1303 with 6,000 men at his back; other bodies were
        soon to follow. Andronicus loaded the <span class="tei tei-q">“Grand
        Company,”</span> as Roger de Flor styled his men, with unlimited
        promises, and a certain amount of ready money. Roger himself was
        given the title of <span class="tei tei-q">“Grand Duke,”</span> and
        married to a lady of the imperial house. After clearing the Turks out
        of the Bithynian coast-land the <span class="tei tei-q">“Grand
        Company”</span> spent the winter of 1303-4 in free quarters along the
        southern coast of Propontis. Their plundering habits and their
        arrogance soon brought them into ill odour with the inhabitants, who
        complained that they were well-nigh as great a curse as the Turks. In
        the next year Roger moved south with his host, and drove the Turks
        out of Lydia and Caria; but instead of putting the emperor into
        possession of the reconquered land, he garrisoned every fortress with
        his own men, and raised and appropriated the imperial taxes. There
        can be little doubt <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg
        318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        that he was plotting to seize on the provinces he had regained, and
        to reign at Ephesus as an independent prince. At last Roger went so
        far as to lay formal siege to Philadelphia, because its inhabitants
        preferred to obey orders from Constantinople, and would not admit him
        within their gates. Andronicus then lured him to an interview at
        Adrianople, and in his very presence the great <span lang="it" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="it"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">condottiere</span></span> was assassinated by
        George the Alan, an officer whose son had been slain in a brawl by
        Roger's soldiers. The Emperor had probably arranged the murder, and
        certainly refused to arrest its perpetrator [1307].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was promptly
        punished. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Grand Company”</span> was not
        disorganized by the loss of its leader, and thought of nothing but
        revenge. Assembling themselves in haste, and abandoning Asia Minor to
        the Turks, they marched on Constantinople, harrying the land far and
        wide with fiendish cruelty. The Emperor sent his son Michael against
        them, but the young prince was disgracefully beaten in two fights at
        Gallipoli and Apros, and the mercenaries spread themselves all over
        Thrace and plundered it up to the gates of the capital. It almost
        looked as if a second Latin Conquest of Constantinople was about to
        take place, for the leaders of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Grand
        Company”</span> got succour from Europe, raised a corps of Turkish
        auxiliaries, and occupied Thrace for two years. But they could not
        storm the walls of Constantinople or Adrianople, and at last, after
        two years of plundering, they had stripped the country so bare that
        they were driven away by famine. Drifting southward and westward they
        ravaged Macedon and Thessaly, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> and at last reached Greece. Here they fell into
        a quarrel with Walter de Brienne, Duke of Athens, slew him in battle
        and took his capital. Then at last did the wandering horde settle
        down; they seized the duchy, divided its fiefs among themselves, and
        established a new dynasty on the Athenian throne. The empire was at
        last quit of them, for when once they ceased to wander the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Grand Company”</span> ceased to be
        dangerous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This disastrous
        war with the mercenaries not only ruined Thrace and Macedonia, but
        was the cause of the final loss of the Byzantine provinces of Asia
        Minor. While Andronicus was feebly attempting to cope with the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Grand Company,”</span> the Seljouk chiefs
        had conquered Lydia and Phrygia once more, and then advanced yet
        further north to siege Mysia and Bithynia. By 1325 they had reduced
        the Emperor's dominions on the east of the straits to a narrow strip,
        reaching from the Dardanelles to the northern exit of the Bosphorus,
        and bounded by the Bithynian hills to the south. Five Seljouk leaders
        had carved out for themselves principalities in the conquered
        districts, Menteshe in the south, Aidin and Saroukhan in Lydia,
        Karasi in Mysia, and in the Bithynian borderland Othman, destined to
        a fame very different from that of his long-forgotten compeers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Othman and
        the rest were turning the once thickly-peopled countries of Western
        Asia Minor into a desert sparsely inhabited by wandering nomads,
        Andronicus II. was busied in a war even more uncalled for than that
        with the mercenaries. He wished to exclude from the succession to the
        throne <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name=
        "Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> his grandson and heir,
        who bore the same name as himself. But the younger Andronicus took
        measures to defend his rights, and raised armed bands. Grandfather
        and grandson were ere long engaged in a long but feebly-conducted
        war, which was only terminated in 1328, when the old man acknowledged
        Andronicus the younger as his heir, and made him his colleague on the
        throne. But his grandson, not contented with this measure of success,
        made him retire from the conduct of affairs, and assumed control over
        every function of government. The name of Andronicus II. was still
        associated with that of Andronicus III. on the coinage and in the
        public prayers, but he took no further part in the rule of the
        empire. In 1332 he died, at a good old age, lamented by no single
        individual in the realm which he had ruled for fifty years. At his
        death the empire was only two-thirds of the size that it had been at
        his accession.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Andronicus III.
        was a shade better than the incapable old man whom he supplanted.
        Though he was given—like all his house—to treachery and deceit, and
        though his life was loose and luxurious, he was at any rate active
        and energetic. He may be described as a weak reflection or copy of
        Manuel Comnenus, being a mighty hunter, a bold spear both in the
        tournament and on the battle-field, and a great spender of money. If
        he had not the brains to keep his empire together, he at any rate
        fought his best, and did not sit apathetically at home like his
        grandfather while everything was going to rack and ruin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,
        Andronicus III. was destined to see the termination of the process
        which had begun under Andronicus II.—the entire loss of the Asiatic
        provinces of the empire to the Turks. It was now with the Ottomans
        almost exclusively that he had to deal; the other Seljouk hordes had
        no longer any marchland along the shrunken frontier of his
        dominions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These new foes of
        the empire deserve a word of description. Othman, the son of
        Ertogrul, was a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg
        322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        vassal of the Seljouk Sultan of Roum, who had been granted a tract in
        the Phrygian highlands under the condition of military service
        against the Greeks. His fief lay in the north-west angle of the great
        central plateau of Asia Minor. Behind it lay the rolling country of
        hills and uplands already occupied by the Seljouks. Before it were
        the Bithynian mountains, with their passes protected by forts, and
        garrisoned by local militia, till the day when they were so
        perversely stripped of their defenders by the action of Michael
        Paleologus. Othman, and his father Ertogrul before him, owned nothing
        in the hills, nor could they have pushed on if Michael had not made
        the way easy for them. But after 1270 the native militia was gone,
        and the followers of Othman, instead of having to face an armed
        population, fighting to protect its own fields, found to oppose them
        only inadequate garrisons of regular troops at long intervals.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Othman's life
        covered two series of great events, the disastrous reign of
        Andronicus II. at Constantinople, and in Asia Minor the no less
        disastrous break-up of the power of his own suzerain, the Sultan of
        Roum. In 1294, Gaiaseddin, the last undisputed sovereign of the
        Seljouk line, fell in battle against rebels; and in 1307, Alaeddin
        III., the last prince who claimed to be supreme Sultan, died in
        exile. This made Othman an independent prince; but he did not take
        the title of Sultan, contenting himself with the humbler name of
        Emir.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Othman's field of
        operation from 1281 to 1326 was the Byzantine borderland of Bithynia
        and Mysia. He was by no means the strongest of the Seljouk
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a name="Pg323"
        id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> chiefs who made a lodgement
        within the borders of the empire, and it took him twenty years before
        he conquered one large town. His wild horsemen harried the open
        sea-coast plain of Bithynia again and again, till at last the
        wretched inhabitants emigrated, or acknowledged him as their
        sovereign. But the towns, within their strong Roman walls, were
        unassailable by the light cavalry which formed his only armed
        strength. The siege of Prusa [Broussa], the capital and key of the
        region, lasted ten years. The Turks built a chain of forts around it
        and gradually made the introduction of provisions more and more
        difficult, till at last a large force was required to march out every
        time that a convoy was expected. At length the inhabitants could find
        no advantage in spending their whole lives in a beleaguered town
        undergoing slow starvation. Prusa surrendered in 1326, and Othman
        heard of the news on his death-bed. The Turkish frontier now once
        again touched the Sea of Marmora, which it had not reached since the
        Crusaders thrust it back inland in 1097.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reign of
        Othman's son Orkhan, the second Emir of the Ottomans, almost
        coincided with that of Andronicus III. All that the one lost the
        other gained. Orkhan's life-work was the completion of the conquest
        of Bithynia, which his father had begun. He took Nicomedia in 1327
        and Nicaea in 1333, with all the surrounding territory, so that
        Andronicus retained nothing but Chalcedon and the district
        immediately facing Constantinople beyond the Bosphorus. Only once did
        he have to meet the Emperor in pitched battle; this was at the fight
        of Pelekanon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg
        324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in
        1329. Andronicus was wounded early in the day, and his army, deprived
        of its leader went to pieces and was severely beaten. After his
        recovery from his wounds the Emperor never faced the Ottomans
        again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After conquering
        Bithynia, Orkhan subdued his nearest neighbours among the other
        Seljouk Emirs, and then turned to organizing his state. This was the
        date of the institution of his famous corps of the Janissaries, the
        first steady infantry that any Eastern power had ever possessed. He
        imposed on his Christian subjects in Mysia and Bithynia a tribute,
        not of money, but of male children. The boys were taken over while
        very young, placed in barracks, educated in the strictest and most
        fanatical Moslem code, and trained to the profession of arms. Having
        light horse enough and to spare, Orkhan taught the Janissaries to
        fight on foot with bow and sabre. They were well drilled, and moved
        in compact masses, which for many ages no foe proved competent to
        sunder and disperse. So thorough was the physical and moral
        discipline to which the Janissaries were subjected, that it was
        almost unknown for one of them to turn back from his career and
        relapse into Christianity. To keep them firm in their allegiance
        there acted not only the military and conventual discipline to which
        they were subject, but the dazzling prospect of future greatness. The
        Ottoman sovereigns made it their rule to select their generals and
        governors, their courtiers and personal attendants from the ranks of
        the tribute-children. It was calculated that more than two-thirds of
        the Grand-Viziers of Turkey, in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth
        centuries, had begun their career as Janissaries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
        generation of the <span class="tei tei-q">“New Soldiery”</span> [for
        such is the meaning of the word Janissary] grew up to the military
        age during the latter half of the reign of Orkhan, and it was he who
        first utilized them on the European shore of the Bosphorus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Andronicus III.
        died in 1241, and left his shrunken dominions to the risks of a
        minority, for his son and heir, John III., was only nine years of
        age. If anything had been wanting to aid in the destruction of the
        empire, it was the arrival of such a contingency. The usual troubles
        soon set in, and the inevitable civil war was not far off.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The evil spirit of
        the time was John Cantacuzenus, the prime minister of the deceased
        emperor. He was a clever, shifty, intriguing courtier, with a turn
        for literature, but had the abilities neither of a general nor of a
        statesman. However, he had read the tale of the rise of the Paleologi
        to some purpose, and had resolved to imitate the career of Michael
        VIII. Now, as in 1258, there was the best of chances for an
        unscrupulous minister to make himself first the colleague and then
        the supplanter of his young master. Cantacuzenus did his best to
        repeat the doings of Michael on Michael's great-great-grandson. He
        bribed and intrigued, made himself a party in the state, and prepared
        for a <span lang="fr" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "fr"><span style="font-style: italic">coup d'état</span></span> when
        the time should be ripe. Unfortunately for himself, Cantacuzenus was
        not of the stuff of which successful usurpers are made. He had his
        scruples and superstitions, and showed a fatal habit of
        procrastination which always <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> led him to act a day too late. The Empress
        Dowager, Anne of Savoy, succeeded in raising a party against him, and
        when he threw off the mask and declared himself emperor he found
        himself unable to seize the capital, though he mustered an army under
        its walls. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg
        327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Finding that he was playing a losing game, Cantacuzenus took the
        usual step of calling in the national enemy to aid him. It was for
        the last time that this was done in Byzantine history, but never
        before had the result been so fatal. The usurper summoned to his aid
        first Stephen Dushan, the king of the Servians, and a little later
        the Turkish princes from across the Aegean—Orkhan the son of Othman,
        and his rival, Amour, Emir of Aidin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These allies kept
        the cause of John Cantacuzenus from destruction, but it was by
        destroying the empire that John had coveted. King Stephen entered
        Macedonia and Thrace, and occupied the whole countryside, except
        Thessalonica and a few other towns. He then pushed further south,
        conquered Thessaly, and made the despot of Epirus do him homage. The
        Byzantine government retained little more than the capital, and the
        districts round Adrianople and Thessalonica. Most of this country was
        lost for ever to the imperial crown, and it seemed as if a Servian
        domination in the Balkan Peninsula was about to begin, for Stephen
        moved south from Servia, made Uscup in Macedonia his capital, and
        proclaimed himself <span class="tei tei-q">“Emperor of the Servians
        and Romans.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would perhaps
        have been well for Christendom if Stephen had actually conquered
        Constantinople and made an end of the empire. In that case there
        would have been a single great power in the Balkan Peninsula, ready
        to meet the oncoming assault of the Turks. But Dushan was not strong
        enough to take the great city, and to the misfortune of Europe he
        died in 1355 leaving a realm extending from the Danube to the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328"
        id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> pass of Thermopylae. But his
        young son Urosh was soon assassinated, and the Servian Empire broke
        up as rapidly as it had grown together. A dozen princes were soon
        scrambling for the remnants of Stephen's heritage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The other allies
        whom John Cantacuzenus called in were the Turks Amour and Orkhan, and
        on them he depended far more than on the Servian. He took over into
        Thrace a large body of Turkish horse, and allowed them to harry the
        country-side and carry away his subjects by thousands, to be sold in
        the slave-markets of Smyrna and Broussa. But the depth of John's
        degradation was reached when he gave his daughter Theodora to Orkhan,
        to be immured in the Turk's harem. Thrace was rapidly assuming the
        aspect of a desert under the incursions of the Ottoman mercenaries of
        Cantacuzenus, when after six years of war the party of the Empress
        Anne consented to recognize the usurper as the colleague and guardian
        of the rightful heir. A hollow peace was patched up, and the two
        Johns could take stock of their dilapidated realm [1347]. The net
        result of their civil war had been that Macedonia and Thessaly were
        in Servian hands, and that Thrace was utterly ruined by the Turks.
        There was nothing left that could be called an empire; all that
        remained was Constantinople and Adrianople, the town of Thessalonica
        and the Byzantine province in the Peloponnesus. Cantacuzenus
        certainly deserves a notable place by the side of Isaac and Alexius
        Angelus, as the third of the great destroyers of the Eastern
        Empire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But his evil work
        was not yet done. For seven <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg
        329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        years he ruled in conjunction with John Paleologus, waging an
        unsuccessful war against Servia in the hopes of winning back Dushan's
        conquests. But in 1354 the young emperor, having attained the age of
        twenty-four, resolved to assert himself, and took arms to dethrone
        his guardian. Cantacuzenus resisted, and sent over to Asia for the
        troops of his son-in-law Orkhan, who crossed into Thrace and drove
        the adherents of the Paleologi out of several fortresses. But a night
        surprise from the side of the sea put John Paleologus in possession
        of Constantinople, and by a fortunate chance he got Cantacuzenus
        himself into his hands. The usurper was, in accordance with the usual
        practice, tonsured and placed in a monastery; by exceptional good
        fortune he was spared the loss of his eyes, and was able to spend the
        remainder of his life in writing a history of his own time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it was of
        little use to sweep away Cantacuzenus while Orkhan's Turks were in
        Thrace. The Ottomans had come as auxiliaries in the war, but they
        were resolved to stop as principals. Suleiman, the son of Orkhan,
        seized Gallipoli for himself, filled it with Turkish families, and
        made it a permanent settlement. This was the first Ottoman foothold
        in Europe, but it was not long to remain isolated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1359 Orkhan
        died, and his successor, Murad I., determined to cross over into
        Europe, and try the fortune of his arms. John Paleologus was not a
        worse man than his immediate predecessors on the throne, but thanks
        to Cantacuzenus he had far less resources than even they had
        possessed. Two years of fighting sufficed to put Thrace in the hands
        of Murad from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg
        330]</span><a name="Pg330" id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> sea
        to sea. A decisive battle in front of Adrianople in 1361 was the
        finishing stroke, and the empire became a mere head without a body;
        its last home-province had been lopped away, and beyond the walls of
        Constantinople no land acknowledged John V. as sovereign save the
        district of Thessalonica and the Peloponnesus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Why Murad I. did
        not finish the task he had begun, and take Constantinople itself, it
        is hard to discern. Its walls were still formidable, and the Genoese
        and Venetians could still protect it on the side of the sea. But a
        siege pressed firmly to an end must at last have triumphed over the
        mere inert resistance of stone and mortar, unsupported by an adequate
        garrison within. However, Murad preferred to press on against
        worthier adversaries than the weak Paleologus, and spent his life in
        incessant and successful wars with the Servians, the Bulgarians, and
        the Seljouk Emirs of Southern Asia Minor. In a reign of thirty years
        he extended his borders to the Balkans on the north, and annexed
        large tracts of Seljouk territory from his brother Emirs in Asia
        Minor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">John Paleologus
        was his humble vassal and slave. After a vain attempt to get help
        from the Pope, this emperor without an empire resolved to make what
        terms he could, and rejoiced when he found that Murad was prepared to
        grant him peace. The Turk was a hard master, and rejoiced in giving
        his vassal unpalatable tasks. Best remembered among the tribulations
        of John is the siege of Philadelphia. That place had preserved a
        precarious independence after all the other cities of Byzantine Asia
        fell into the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg
        331]</span><a name="Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        hands of the Turkish Emirs. Being far away in the Lydian hills, it
        lost touch with Constantinople, and had become a free town. Murad,
        wishing to subdue it, compelled John V. and his son Manuel to march
        in person against the last Christian stronghold in Asia. The Emperor
        submitted to the degradation, and Philadelphia surrendered when it
        saw the imperial banner hoisted among the horse-tails of the Turkish
        pashas above the camp of the besiegers. The humiliation of the empire
        could go no further than when the heir of Justinian and Basil
        Bulgaroktonos took the field at the behest of an upstart Turkish
        Emir, in order to extinguish the last relics of freedom among his own
        compatriots.</p>

        (1370-1453.)</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tale of the
        last seventy-five years of the Byzantine Empire is a mere piece of
        local history, and no longer forms an important thread in the web of
        the history of Christendom. Murad the Turk might have taken
        Constantinople in 1370, without altering in any very great measure
        the course of events in Eastern Europe during the next century. For
        after 1370 the empire ceased to exercise its old function of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“bulwark of Christendom against the
        Ottomite.”</span> That duty now fell to the Servians and Hungarians,
        who continued to discharge it for the next hundred and fifty years.
        The Paleologi, by their base subservience to the Turk, protracted the
        life of the empire long after all justification for its existence had
        disappeared.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If Constantinople
        had fallen in 1370, instead of 1453, there are only two ways in which
        European history would have been somewhat modified. The commercial
        resources of Genoa and Venice would have been straitened before the
        appointed time, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg
        333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ere
        the Cape route to India enabled Europe to dispense with the use of
        Constantinople as half-way house to the East. And, we may add, the
        Renaissance would have been shorn of some of its brilliance in the
        next century, if the dispersion of the Greeks had taken place before
        Italy was quite fitted to receive them and turn their learning to
        account. But in other respects it is hard to see that much harm would
        have resulted from the fall of Constantinople in the end of the
        fourteenth rather than the middle of the fifteenth century.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While Murad I. was
        conquering the Servians and Bulgarians, John Paleologus was dragging
        out a long and unhonoured old age. His reign was protracted for over
        half a century, but his later years were much vexed by the undutiful
        behaviour of his children. His son Andronicus twice rebelled against
        him, and once succeeded in seizing the throne for a short space.
        Andronicus allied himself unto Saoudji, a son of Murad I., who
        plotted a similar treason against his father the Emir. But Murad
        easily quelled the rebellion, put out the eyes of his own son, and
        sent Andronicus in chains to John II., bidding him to follow his
        example. The Emperor did not dare to disobey, and ordered his son to
        be blinded. But the operation was so ineffectually performed that
        Andronicus retained a measure of sight, and was even able to venture
        on a second rebellion against his father.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In consequence of
        his heir's unnatural conduct, the aged John determined to deprive him
        of his succession, and when he died in 1391, he left the throne to
        his second son Manuel, and not to his eldest born. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Manuel II. was above the average of the
        Paleologi, and showed some signs of capacity, but of what use was it
        to a prince whose sole dominions were Constantinople, Thessalonica,
        and the Peloponnesus? He had neither military strength nor money to
        justify rebellion against the Turk, and could only wait on the course
        of events.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was,
        however, one moment in Manuel's life at which the liberation of the
        empire from the Ottoman suzerainty appeared possible and even
        probable. In 1402, there burst into Asia Minor a great horde of
        Tartars, under the celebrated conqueror Timour [Tamerlane]. Sultan
        Bayezid, the successor of Murad I., went forth to withstand the
        invader. But at Angora in Galatia, he suffered a crushing defeat, and
        the Ottoman Empire seemed likely to perish by the sword. Bayezid was
        captured, his trusty Janissaries were cut to pieces, his light
        horsemen scattered to the winds. The Tartars swarmed all over Asia
        Minor, occupied Broussa, the Ottoman capital, and restored to their
        thrones all the Seljouk Emirs whose dominions Murad I. had annexed.
        Bayezid died in captivity, and his sons began to fight over the
        remains of his empire: Prince Suleiman seized Adrianople, Prince Eesa
        Nicaea, and each declared himself Sultan.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was a rare
        opportunity for Manuel Paleologus: the thieves had fallen out, and
        the rightful owner might perchance come again to his own, if he
        played his cards well. The control of the Straits was of great
        importance to each of the Turkish pretenders, so much so, that Manuel
        was able to sell his aid to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg
        335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Suleiman for a heavy price. In order to keep Eesa from crossing the
        water, the holder of the European half of the Ottoman realm ceded to
        the Emperor <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg
        336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Thessalonica, the lower valley of the Strymon, the coast of Thessaly,
        and all the seaports of the Black Sea from the mouth of the Bosphorus
        up to Varna.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a moment
        Manuel once more ruled what might in courtesy be called an empire,
        and so long as the Ottomans were occupied in civil war he contrived
        to retain his gains. The strife of the sons of Bayezid lasted ten
        years: Suleiman was slain by his brother Musa, Eesa by his brother
        Mohammed, and the two supplanters continued the war. By all Oriental
        analogies their empire ought to have fallen to pieces, for it is very
        much easier to build up a new state in the East than to keep together
        an old one which is breaking asunder. But Mohammed, the youngest of
        the sons of Bayezid, was a man of genius: he triumphed over the last
        of his brothers, and united all the remnants of the Ottoman realm
        that remained. Much had been lost to the Seljouk Emirs in Asia Minor,
        and to the Servians and Manuel Paleologus in Europe, but the rest was
        back in Mohammed's hands by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 1421. Manuel had very
        luckily cast in his lot with Mohammed during the later years of the
        Turkish civil war, and his ally let him enjoy the dominions he had
        recovered by his original treaty with Suleiman in 1403.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Between 1402 and
        1421, Europe had an unparalleled opportunity to rid herself of the
        Ottomans. Unfortunately it was not taken. Sigismund, king of Hungary,
        and at the same time Emperor, was the sovereign on whom the duty of
        leading the attack ought to have fallen. But Sigismund was now
        engaged in his great struggle with the Hussites in <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Bohemia. This wretched religious war
        directed the strength of Hungary northward when it was wanted in the
        south. Without such a power to back them the Servians, though they
        recovered their own liberty as a result of the battle of Angora,
        could do nothing towards driving the Turks from the Balkans. There
        was never any sympathy between Serb and Magyar, and save under the
        direct pressure of fear of a Moslem invasion they would not act
        together. The Hungarian kings had always laid claim to a suzerainty
        over the crown of Servia, and from time to time tried to convert
        their neighbours to Roman Catholicism by force of arms. Hence there
        was no love lost between them, and a crusade to expel the Turks was
        never concerted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mahomet the
        Unifier died in 1421, and evil days at once set in for Constantinople
        and for Christendom, when his ambitious son Murad II. came to the
        throne. Manuel Paleologus was one of the first to feel the change in
        the times. He tried to make trouble for Murad, by supporting against
        him two claimants to the Ottoman Sultanate, each named Mustapha, one
        the uncle, the other the brother of the new ruler. This drew down on
        the empire the fate which had been delayed since 1370: the Sultan
        declared war on Manuel, took one after another all the fortresses
        which had been recovered by the peace of 1403, and finally laid siege
        to Constantinople. For the last time the walls of the city proved
        strong enough to repulse an assault. Though Murad levelled against
        them cannon, then seen for the first time in the East, built movable
        towers to shelter his troops, and launched his terrible Janissaries
        to the assault, he could not <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page339">[pg 339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> succeed. The report of a miraculous vision of
        the Virgin, who vouchsafed to reveal herself as the defender of the
        city, encouraged the Greeks to resist with a better spirit than might
        have been expected. At last the pretender Mustapha, whom Manuel had
        supplied with money to cause a revolt against his brother, began to
        stir up such trouble in Asia Minor, that the Sultan determined to
        raise the siege and march against him. He granted Manuel peace, on
        the condition that he ceded all his dominions save the cities of
        Constantinople and Thessalonica and the Peloponnesian province. Thus
        the empire once more sank back into a state of vassalage to the
        Ottomans [1422].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Manuel II. died
        three years after, at the age of seventy-seven. He was the last
        sovereign of Constantinople who won even a transient smile from
        fortune. The tale of the last thirty years of the empire is one of
        unredeemed gloom.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To Manuel
        succeeded his son John VI., whose whole reign was passed in peace,
        without an attempt to shake off the Turkish yoke; such an attempt
        indeed would have been hopeless, unless backed by aid from without.
        As Manuel II. once observed, <span class="tei tei-q">“the empire now
        requires a bailiff not a statesman to rule it.”</span> Treaties,
        wars, and alliances were not for him: all that he could do was to try
        to save a little money, and to keep his walls in good repair, and
        even these humble tasks were not always feasible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the
        descriptions of Constantinople in the fifteenth century, whether
        written by Greek natives or by Western travellers, bear witness to a
        state of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg
        340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        exhaustion and debility which make us wonder that the empire did not
        collapse sooner. The country outside the walls was a desert. Within
        them more than half the ground was unoccupied, and covered only by
        ruins which testified to ancient magnificence. The great palace by
        the Augustaeum, which sheltered so many generations of emperors, had
        grown so dilapidated that the Paleologi dwelt in a mere corner of it.
        Part of the porticoes of St. Sophia had fallen down, and the Greeks
        could not afford to repair even the greatest sanctuary of their
        faith. The population of the city had shrunk to about a hundred
        thousand souls, most of them dwelling in great poverty. Such commerce
        and wealth as still survived in Constantinople had passed almost
        entirely into the hands of the Italians of Genoa and Venice, whose
        fortified factories at Galata and Pera now contained the bulk of the
        wares that passed through the city. The military strength of the
        empire was composed of about four thousand mercenary troops, of whom
        many were Franks and hardly any were born subjects of the empire. The
        splendid court, which had once been the wonder of East and West, had
        shrunk to such modest dimensions that a Burgundian traveller noted
        with surprise that no more than eight attendants accompanied the
        empress when she went in state to worship in St. Sophia.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">John VI., in spite
        of the caution with which he avoided all action, was destined to see
        the empire lose its most important possession beyond the walls of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341"
        id="Pg341" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Constantinople. His brother
        Andronicus, governor of Thessalonica, traitorously sold that city to
        the Venetians for 50,000 zecchins. The Sultan, incensed at a transfer
        of Greek territory having taken place without his permission, pounced
        down on the place, expelled the Venetians and annexed Thessalonica to
        the Ottoman Empire [1430].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief feature
        of the reign of the last John Paleologus was his attempt to win aid
        for the empire by enlisting sympathy in Western Europe. He determined
        to conform to Roman Catholicism and to throw himself on the
        generosity of the Pope. Accordingly he betook himself to Italy in
        1438, with the Patriarch of Constantinople and many bishops in his
        train. He appeared at the Councils of Ferrara and Florence, and was
        solemnly received into the Roman Church in the Florentine Duomo, on
        July 6, 1439. It had apparently escaped John's notice that Eugenius
        IV., the pope of his own day, was a very different personage from the
        great pontiffs of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, who were able
        to depose sovereigns and send forth Crusades at their good pleasure.
        Since the Great Schism the papacy had been hopelessly discredited in
        Christendom. Eugenius IV. was engaged in waging a defensive war
        against the Council of Basle, which was attempting to depose him, and
        had little thought or power to spend on aiding the Eastern
        Christians. All that John could get from him was a sum of money and a
        body of three hundred mercenary troops. This was a poor return for
        his journey and conversion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Only one thing of
        importance was accomplished by <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page342">[pg 342]</span><a name="Pg342" id="Pg342" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the apostasy of the Emperor—the outbreak of a
        venomous ecclesiastical struggle at Constantinople between the
        conformists who had taken the oath at Florence, and the bulk of the
        clergy, who disowned the treaty of union. John was practically
        boycotted by the majority of his subjects; the Orthodox priests
        ceased to pray for him, and the populace refused to enter St. Sophia
        again, when it had been profaned by the celebration of the Roman
        Mass. The opinion of the majority of the Greeks was summed up in the
        exclamation of the Grand-Duke John Notaras—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Better the turban of the Turk in Constantinople than the
        Pope's Tiara.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last years of
        the reign of John VI. coincided with the great campaigns of Huniades
        and Ladislas of Poland against the Turks. For a moment it seemed as
        if the gallant king of Poland and Hungary, backed by his great Warden
        of the Marches, might restore the Balkan lands to Christendom. They
        thrust Murad II. back over the Balkans, and appeared in triumph at
        Sophia. But the fatal battle of Varna [1444] ended the career of King
        Ladislas in an untimely death, and after that fight the Ottomans were
        obviously fated to accomplish their destiny without a check. John
        Paleologus watched the struggle without movement if not without
        concern. He was too cautious to stir a finger to aid the Hungarians,
        for he knew that if he once offended the Sultan his days would be
        numbered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">John VI. passed
        away in 1448, and Sultan Murad in 1451. The one was succeeded by his
        brother Constantine, the last Christian sovereign of Byzantium,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343"
        id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the other by his young son
        Mohammed the Conqueror. Constantine was a Romanist like his elder
        brother, and was therefore treated with great suspicion and coolness
        by his handful of subjects. He was the best man that the house of
        Paleologus had ever reared, brave, pious, generous, and forgiving.
        Like King Hosea of Israel, <span class="tei tei-q">“he did not evil
        as the kings that were before him,”</span> yet was destined to bear
        the penalty for all the sins and follies of his long line of
        predecessors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mohammed II., the
        most commanding personality among the whole race of Ottoman Sultans,
        set his heart from the first on seizing Constantinople, the natural
        centre of his empire, and making it his capital. Some excuse had to
        be found for falling on his vassal: the one that he chose was a
        rather unwise request which Constantine had made. There dwelt at
        Constantinople a Turkish prince of the royal house named Orkhan, for
        whom Mohammed paid a considerable subsidy, on condition that he was
        kept out of the way of mischief and plotting. Some unhappy
        inspiration impelled Constantine to ask for an increase in the
        subsidy, and to hint that Orkhan had claims to the Sultanate. This
        was excuse enough for Mohammed: without taking the trouble to declare
        war he sent out troops and engineers, and began to erect forts on
        Greek soil, only four miles away from Constantinople, at the
        narrowest point of the Bosphorus, so as to block the approach to the
        city from the Black Sea. The Emperor did not dare to remonstrate, but
        when the Turks began to pull down a much-venerated church, in order
        to utilize its stones in the new fort, a few Greeks took <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> arms and drove the masons away. They were
        at once cut down by the Turkish guards: Constantine demanded redress,
        and then Mohammed, having fairly picked his wolf-and-lamb quarrel
        with his unfortunate vassal, commenced open hostilities [Autumn
        1452].</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Turkish light
        troops at once appeared to blockade the city while the Sultan began
        to collect a great train of cannon at Adrianople, and to build a
        large fleet of war galleys in the ports of Asia: the siege was to
        begin in the ensuing spring.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The empire was now
        in its death agony, and Constantine recognized the fact. He spent the
        winter in making frantic appeals to the Pope and the Italian naval
        powers to save him from destruction. Nicholas V. was willing enough
        to help; now that the Emperor was a convert to Catholicism something
        must be done to aid him. But all that the Pope could send was a
        cardinal, a moderate sum of money, and a few hundred soldiers of
        fortune hastily hired in Italy. Venice and Genoa could have done much
        more, but they had so often heard the cry of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Wolf”</span> raised that they did not realize the danger
        to their Eastern trade at its true extent. From Genoa, Giovanni
        Giustiniani brought no more than two galleys and three hundred men.
        Venice did even less, only commissioning the bailiff of its factory
        at Galata to arm such able-bodied Venetians as were with him for the
        protection of the city. Altogether the Franks, counting both trained
        mercenaries and armed burghers, who co-operated in the defence of
        Constantinople, were not more than three thousand strong. Yet either
        Genoa or Venice <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg
        345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        could have thrown a hundred galleys and twenty thousand men into the
        scale if they had chosen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Constantine's own
        troops were about four thousand strong, but he hoped to recruit them
        by a general levy of the male population of the city. He issued a
        passionate appeal to his subjects to join in saving the holy city,
        the centre of Eastern Christendom. But the Greeks only remembered
        that he was an apostate, who had foresworn the faith of his fathers
        and done homage to the Pope. They stood aside in sullen apathy, and
        from the whole population of the city only two thousand volunteers
        were enlisted. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg
        346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Theological bitterness led the blind multitude to cry with Notaras
        that it preferred the Turk to the Roman.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In April, 1453,
        the young Sultan, with seventy thousand picked troops at his back,
        laid formal siege to the city on the land side, while a fleet of
        several hundred war galleys beset the Bosphorus. The end could not be
        for a moment doubtful; nine thousand men could not hope to defend the
        vast circuit of the land and sea-wall against a veteran army urged on
        by a young and fiery general. Mohammed set his cannon to play on the
        walls, and it was soon seen that the tough old Roman mortar and stone
        that had blunted the siege engines of so many foes could not resist
        the force of gunpowder. The Sultan's artillery was rude, but it was
        heavy and numerous; ere long the walls began to come down in flakes,
        and breaches commenced to show themselves in several places.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Constantine XIII.
        and his second in command, the Genoese Giustiniani, did all that
        brave and skilful men might, in protracting the siege. They led
        sorties, organized attacks by water on the Turkish fleet, and
        endeavoured to drive off the siege artillery of the enemy by a
        counter fire of cannon. But it was found that the old walls were too
        narrow to bear the guns, and where any were hoisted up and brought to
        bear, their recoil shook the fabric in such a dangerous way that the
        fire was soon obliged to cease.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At sea the
        Christians won one great success, when four galleys from the Aegean
        forced their way in through the whole Turkish fleet, and reached the
        Golden Horn in safety, after sinking many of their assailants. But
        the Turks had as great a numerical <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> superiority on the water as on land, and the
        inevitable could only be delayed. Mohammed even succeeded in getting
        control of the harbour of the city, above its mouth, by dragging
        light galleys on rollers over the neck of land between the Bosphorus
        and the Golden Horn, and launching them in the inland waters just
        above Galata. Thus the inner, as well as the outer, sea-face of the
        city was beset by enemies.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The end came on
        May 29, 1453. The Sultan had opened several practicable breaches, of
        which the chief lay in the north-west angle of the city by the gate
        of St. Romanus, where two whole towers and the curtain between them
        had been battered down and choked the ditch. The storm was obviously
        at hand, and the doomed Emperor was obliged to face his fate. Greek
        historians dwelt with loving sorrow on the last hours of the
        unfortunate prince. He left the breach at midnight, partook of the
        sacrament according to the Latin rite in St. Sophia, and snatched a
        few hours of troubled sleep in his half-ruined palace. Next morning,
        with the dawn, he rose to ride back to the post of danger. His
        ministers and attendants crowded round his horse as he started on
        what all knew to be his last journey. Looking steadfastly on them he
        prayed one and all to pardon him for any offence that he might
        wittingly or unwittingly have committed against any man. The crowd
        answered with sobs and wails, and with the sounds of woe ringing in
        his ears Constantine rode slowly off to meet his death.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The assault
        commenced at dawn; three main attacks and several secondary ones were
        directed against weak spots in the wall. But the chief stress
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348"
        id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was on the great breach by the
        gate of St. Romanus. There the Emperor himself and Giustiniani at his
        side stood in the midst of the yawning gap with their best men around
        them, and opposed a barrier of steel to the oncoming assailants.
        Twelve thousand Janissaries, sabre in hand, formed successive columns
        of attack; as soon as one was beaten off another delivered its
        assault. They fell by hundreds before the swords of the mailed men in
        the breach, for their felt caps and unarmoured bodies were easy marks
        for the ponderous weapons of the fifteenth century. But the ranks of
        the defenders grew thin and weary; Giustiniani was wounded in the
        face by an arrow, and taken on board his galley to die. Constantine
        at last stood almost alone in the breach, and a forlorn hope of
        Janissaries headed by one Hassan of Ulubad, whom Turkish chroniclers
        delight to honour, at last forced their way over the wall. The
        Emperor and his companions were trodden under foot, and the
        victorious army rushed into the desolate streets of Constantinople,
        seeking in vain for foes to fight. The Greeks, half expecting that
        God would interfere to save the queen of Christian cities by a
        miracle, had crowded into the churches, and were passing the fatal
        hour in frantic prayer! The shouts of the victorious enemy soon
        showed them how the day had gone, and the worshippers were dragged
        out in crowds, to be claimed as slaves and divided among the
        conquerors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mohammed II. rode
        through the breach after his men, and descended into the city,
        scanning from within the streets that so many Eastern conquerors had
        in vain desired to see. He bade his men search <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> for the Emperor, and the corpse of
        Constantine was found at last beneath a heap of slain, so gashed and
        mauled that it was only identified by the golden eagles on his mail
        shoes. The Turk struck off his head, and sent it round their chief
        cities as a token of triumph. Riding through the hippodrome towards
        St. Sophia, Mohammed noted the Delphic tripod with its three
        snakes,<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href=
        "#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> standing
        where Constantine the Great had placed it eleven hundred years
        before. Either because the menacing heads of the serpents provoked
        him, or merely because he wished to try the strength of his arm, the
        Sultan rose in his stirrups and smote away the jaws of the nearest
        snake with one blow of his mace. There was something typical in the
        deed though Mohammed knew it not. He had defaced the monument of the
        first great victory of the West over the East. He, the successor in
        spirit not only of Xerxes but of Chosroës and Moslemah and many
        another Oriental potentate, who had failed where he succeeded, could
        not better signalize the end of Greek freedom than by dealing a
        scornful blow at that ancient memorial, erected in the first days of
        Grecian greatness, to celebrate the turning back of the Persians on
        the field of Plataea.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last the Sultan
        came to St. Sophia, where the crowd of wailing captives was being
        divided among his soldiery. He rode in at the eastern door, and bade
        a mollah ascend the pulpit and repeat there the formula of the Moslem
        faith. So the cry that God was great and Mohammed his prophet rang
        through <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name=
        "Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the dome where thirty
        generations of patriarchs had celebrated the Holy Mysteries, and all
        Europe and Asia knew the end was come of the longest tale of Empire
        that Christendom has yet seen.</p>

              Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
              electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
              computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new
              computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of
              volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Volunteers
              and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
              they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s goals
              and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
              Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a
              secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
              generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
